After the death of his parents, Peter was raised by his <a href=\"../../uncle-ben/29-3114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uncle Ben</a> and <a href=\"../../aunt-may/29-1780/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aunt May</a> in a <a href=\"/forest-hills-residence/4020-57247/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57247\">modest house</a> in Forest Hills, <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>. While still in <a href=\"/midtown-high-school/4020-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55690\">High School</a>, Peter attended a science exhibition about radiology where he was bitten by a <a href=\"/radioactive-spider/4055-56442/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56442\">radioactive spider</a>, granting him the proportionate strength and agility of a spider as well as a \" <a href=\"/spider-sense/4015-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56106\">Spider-Sense</a>\" that warns him of nearby danger. In order to test his new abilities \\u2013 and earn some cash, Peter participated in a wrestling challenge against <a href=\"/crusher-hogan/4005-15480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15480\">Crusher Hogan</a>. He easily won the challenge and also gained the attention of the media. Afterwards while backstage, Peter saw a burglar run past him but did nothing to stop him as it wasn\\u2019t his problem. Later that night when Peter arrived home, he was told by a policeman that his Uncle Ben had been murdered by someone who broke into their house. The cop mentioned they had tracked the killer to a warehouse. In his anger Peter put on his wrestling costume and went after the murderer himself. After arriving at the warehouse and easily defeating Uncle Ben\\u2019s killer, Peter saw that it was the same <a href=\"/the-burglar/4005-15279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15279\">burglar</a> he didn\\u2019t stop at the arena\\u2026 thus learning that \"<a href=\"/with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility/4015-40616/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40616\">with great power comes great responsibility</a>\".</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026958\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026958\"><img alt=\"Spidey\\'s First Appearance\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></a><figcaption>Spidey\\'s First Appearance</figcaption></figure><p>In 1962, <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel Comics</a> editor and head writer <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> was looking for a new superhero idea. He decided to create Spider-Man as a character with whom teens could identify, as there was a recent surge in teenage demand for comics. Lee was supposedly inspired for the concept of Spider-Man after observing a spider climb up a wall. Lee had to convince publisher <a href=\"/martin-goodman/4040-43801/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43801\">Martin Goodman</a> to introduce Spider-Man in the last issue of the canceled series <a href=\"/amazing-adult-fantasy/4050-2043/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2043\">Amazing Adult Fantasy</a>, which was renamed <a href=\"/amazing-fantasy/4050-5533/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy</a> for that issue (#15, Aug. 1962). Lee then approached legendary artist <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> for an initial character design. However Lee was dissatisfied with Kirby\\u2019s attempt as the character turned out to be too heroic and Spider-Man was supposed to be a teenage boy. Lee then turned to <a href=\"/steve-ditko/4040-4026/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko</a> who developed the now iconic look of Spider-Man.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Peter Parker originally decided to use his powers to make money but after Uncle Ben\\'s death he decided to use his powers for good. In many ways, this makes Spider-Man less of the \\'boy scout\\' character people think; the fact that he used his powers to have fun in the first place is something people can relate to. Initially, Peter Parker is shy and timid, but the Spider-Man alter-ego was a form of liberation and heroism, and he used it to gain confidence. However, he found the moral urge later, though some of his confidence and liberation remains, making him a sarcastic wise-guy.</p><p>He has a extremely powerful moral urge for good which is so strong that it made him stop working for the Pro-Registration side despite having his mentor and friends on said side.</p><p>He also has a very compassionate disposition that it can be said that he isn\\'t just the most compassionate in the Marvel Universe but also one of the most compassionate period.</p><p>One thing he is well known for is his humor something that has been known to greatly irritate his enemies and has sometimes even let him win the fight. Furthermore The combination of moral obligation, compassion, and humor makes him one of the most trustworthy, good people to hang out with.</p><p>The time between Spider-Man capturing the burglar that killed Uncle Ben and him becoming a superhero was told over 30 years after his origin when the <a href=\"/amazing-fantasy/4050-5533/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy</a> series was continued in 1995 by writer <a href=\"/kurt-busiek/4040-41741/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41741\">Kurt Busiek</a> (#16-18, Dec. 1995 \\u2013 Mar. 1996). After catching the burglar that killed Ben, Peter had given up being Spider-Man as it reminded him of his irresponsible behavior that ultimately led to his uncle\\u2019s death. Even though <a href=\"/maxie-shiffman/4005-25215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25215\">Maxie Shiffman</a>, the agent he had hired when he was a costumed wrestler, was putting out ads to track down Spider-Man, Peter didn\\u2019t want anything to do with that life. Ben had been the only earner in the family and after his death Peter and his Aunt May were struggling for money. A salesman tried to con May into buying furniture that Ben had apparently left a deposit on before his death. Although the salesman had seemed genuine at the time, Peter caught <a href=\"/mr-vale/4005-83138/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83138\">Mr. Vale</a> pulling the same stunt on an old widower when he was swinging through the city in his Spider-Man costume to clear his head. Spider-Man followed Mr. Vale to a warehouse where he discovered a whole gang of organized criminals led by <a href=\"/the-undertaker/4005-83137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83137\">The Undertaker</a>. Spider-Man challenged the gang and soon had them rounded up for the police. Chronologically this was the first time Spider-Man had been threatened with a gun. More significantly, during the fight he discovered his <a href=\"/spider-sense/4015-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56106\">Spider-Sense</a> for the first time. Capturing these criminals lead Peter to believe that this is how he has to make up for Uncle Ben\\u2019s death, by using his powers to help others.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349326\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.66429298067141\" data-width=\"983\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 983px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349326\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man\\'s first encounter with a \\'super\\'.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 983w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man\\'s first encounter with a \\'super\\'.\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 983w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man\\'s first encounter with a \\'super\\'.</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man became a force for good, from stopping muggings to rescuing workers at a construction site. These heroic activities also gained him positive media attention but he still didn\\u2019t want to get back in show business. Even after Shiffman told him they could make millions, Peter chose responsibility over money. His heroism had also earned Spider-Man a certain fan named <a href=\"/flash-thompson/4005-1489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Flash Thompson</a>. Spider-Man soon encountered another teenager with superpowers of her own and he and <a href=\"/josephine-pulaski/4005-25313/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25313\">Joey Pulaski</a> became friends. However it turned out that Joey was working for <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">The Kingpin</a> and the friends inevitably clashed, resulting in Joey\\u2019s defeat and arrest. Although portrayed as just a misguided kid, chronologically Joey Pulaski was the first super powered being Spider-Man had encountered.</p><p>After defeating Joey Spider-Man\\u2019s fame rose further. One day after seeing his aunt continue to struggle with the household finances, Peter finally decided he had to bring in some money. He contacted Maxie Shiffman who booked him an interview on a TV show. Spider-Man was given the slot of astronaut <a href=\"/john-jameson/4005-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John Jameson</a> much to the vexation of his father, publicist <a href=\"/j-jonah-jameson/4005-1487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J. Jonah Jameson</a>. As the host began to introducing the show\\u2019s guests he was attacked by the super powered villain <a href=\"/supercharger/4005-41244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41244\">Supercharger</a>, who announced he will kill everyone in the audience to prove how dangerous super powered beings were. Spider-Man had never encountered a super villain before and thought real super heroes should deal with this. He attempted to call <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">The Fantastic Four</a> but after Supercharger attacked someone in the audience, Spider-Man stepped in and defeated his first super villain. \\u201cbecause that\\u2019s what super heroes do\\u201d.</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><h3>Becoming a Hero</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056898\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.61647727272727\" data-width=\"704\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 704px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056898\"><img alt=\"Peter mourning Uncle Ben\\'s Death\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 704w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peter mourning Uncle Ben\\'s Death\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 704w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Peter mourning Uncle Ben\\'s Death</figcaption></figure><p>Peter\\'s first super-villain confrontation was with a communist spy called the <a href=\"../../chameleon/29-4458/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon</a> who could disguise himself as anyone. He attempted to disguise himself as Spider-Man and steal some important documents but he was defeated by the debuting hero, restoring his good name. Peter went on to get a job at the Daily Bugle as a photographer, selling photos to J. Jonah Jameson even though they were usually used against him. He eventually fought his second super villain, <a href=\"../../vulture/29-4459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Vulture</a>. Due to his inexperience, Spider-Man was defeated but when the villain got cocky, Spider-Man used a gadget of his own to defeat The Vulture. Spider-Man then had his first confrontation with his most dangerous villain yet, the tentacled madman known as <a href=\"../../doctor-octopus/29-1485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Octopus</a>. Spider-Man was defeated by the more powerful Doctor Octopus in their initial encounter which caused Peter to doubt himself for the first time. He was encouraged by a speech given by the Human Torch to keep on fighting. Spider-Man managed to defeat the villain by knocking him out with one punch to the jaw, since Ock\\'s powers came only from his tentacles. He would follow up this victory by fighting the shape shifting <a href=\"/sandman/4005-3544/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3544\">Sandman</a>, the lethal <a href=\"/lizard/4005-1488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1488\">Lizard</a>, who is actually Peter\\'s mentor and friend Curt Connors, the <a href=\"/enforcers/4060-32265/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32265\">Enforcers</a>, <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a>, <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio</a>, <a href=\"/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">Kraven the Hunter</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>, and his soon to-be arch-nemesis the <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Green Goblin</a>.</p><p>After being defeated on two more occasions by Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus became more determined to defeat his foe and formed the <a href=\"../../sinister-six/65-40429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sinister Six</a>, a group consisting of five other villains who all share the same grudge against the young hero. Ock had each villain face Spider-Man individually so that every member could reap the glory of Spider-Man\\'s death, but he secretly devised this plan to ensure the other villains\\' defeat each time. After rendering Spider-Man tired, Otto lured him to a fight by kidnapping <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May</a> and <a href=\"/betty-brant/4005-2484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2484\">Betty Brant</a>.

During his early career, Spider-Man would frequently team up with other heroes such as <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>, <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">the X-Men</a>, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, and the <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> in particular. Peter and Betty broke up after her brother was killed. She couldn\\'t bear the thought of losing another loved one as she feared that Peter would die while taking pictures of Spider-Man. She later settled in with <a href=\"/ned-leeds/4005-12354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12354\">Ned Leeds</a>.</p><h3><b>College Years</b></h3><p>After graduating from High School, Peter Parker enrolled at ESU ( <a href=\"/empire-state-university/4020-43783/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43783\">Empire State University</a>) where Flash introduced him to <a href=\"/harry-osborn/4005-2478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2478\">Harry Osborn</a> and <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy</a>. During this time, Aunt May suffered from a serious heart attack. Peter would constantly blow his friends off and they saw this as an insult. Eventually their relationship would get better as Peter became more involved with his peers. He and Harry became best friends and roommates. Peter also started dating Gwen Stacy. He would also meet <a href=\"../../anna-may-watson/29-33193/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anna Watson\\'s</a> niece <a href=\"../../mary-jane/29-13380/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mary Jane</a>. Although he was attracted to Mary Jane, Peter decided to settle with Gwen because MJ was too much of a \"party girl\" for him. Peter loves Gwen, but their relationship was strained a bit by him constantly leaving to fight crime. Their relationship was saved by Gwen\\'s father, <a href=\"../../captain-george-stacy/29-2479/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Police Captain George Stacy</a>, an ally of Spider-Man, who approved of Peter dating his daughter. Gwen\\'s father was later killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, after he was crushed by falling debris while saving a child. In his dying breath, George called Spider-Man \"Peter\", revealing that he had always known about his dual identity and urged him to take care of Gwen. George\\'s death caused a strain in the couple\\'s relationship because Gwen blamed Spider-Man for her loss. She left Peter for some time to live with her uncle in <a href=\"../../london/34-55798/\" rel=\"nofollow\">London</a>.</p><h3>Arch-Nemesis: Green Goblin</h3><p>After suffering numerous defeats at the hands of Spider-Man, the Green Goblin vowed to destroy his foe once and for all. Using a special gas that blocks Peter\\'s Spider-Sense, the Goblin followed Peter around and discovered his secret identity. Now knowing Peter was Spider-Man, the Green Goblin kidnapped him, and although he has the chance to kill Peter, the Goblin instead revealed his own secret identity. He was Norman Osborn, a ruthless businessman who was also Harry\\'s father. Norman released Spider-Man from his restraints to defeat him in combat and prove his superiority. The Web-Slinger managed to defeat him and knocked him into some chemicals, resulting in Norman having amnesia and no recollection of both his and Peter\\'s alternate egos.</p><p>Spider-Man also fought the <a href=\"../../rhino/29-2126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rhino</a>, <a href=\"../../shocker/29-4825/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shocker</a>, and the <a href=\"../../mac-gargan/29-4484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scorpion</a>. At one point, Peter felt that he was unable to carry the burden of being Spider-Man any longer and considered retiring from super-heroics. When the <a href=\"../../kingpin/29-1483/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingpin</a> of Crime made his move to take over the city, Peter knew that it was still his responsibility to protect the innocent and so he defeated this crime-lord and returned to crime fighting.</p><h3><b>Death of Gwen Stacy and Aftermath</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862540\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0538194444444\" data-width=\"576\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 576px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862540\"><img alt=\"One of Spider-Man\\'s defining moments\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px\" data-width=\"607\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg 576w\"><noscript><img alt=\"One of Spider-Man\\'s defining moments\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px\" data-width=\"607\"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of Spider-Man\\'s defining moments</figcaption></figure><p>At the end of the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\">Silver Age</a>, Norman Osborn\\'s memories began to flood back. He decided to hurt Peter as much as possible as the Green Goblin. He kidnapped Gwen Stacy and held her hostage at the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man went to save Gwen and, despite being ill at the time, managed to defeat the Goblin. The Goblin threw Gwen off the bridge and, although Peter caught her by attaching a web line to her leg as she fell, the drop caused her neck to snap. As Spider-Man held Gwen\\'s dead body, he vowed to kill the Goblin. He tracked him down to one of his warehouses. He brutally pummeled the Goblin in a fit of rage but managed to stop himself from committing murder. In one last attempt to achieve victory, Norman sent his Goblin Glider to impale Spider-Man from behind. Peter ducks and the Goblin is apparently killed from being impaled by his own glider. Mary Jane consoled Peter on the death of Gwen and the two started to date. Peter eventually proposed to her, but she refused and ended up breaking up with him. At this time <a href=\"../../jackal/29-10974/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miles Warren</a>, a college professor obsessed with Gwen became the deranged villain known as the <a href=\"/jackal/4005-10974/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10974\">Jackal</a>. He hired the <a href=\"../../punisher/29-1525/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Punisher</a> to kill Spider-Man and he also made copies of both Gwen and Peter. The <a href=\"../../scarlet-spider/29-6286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter copy</a> escaped and <a href=\"../../gwen-stacy-clone/29-52936/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gwen\\'s copy</a> eventually went back to Miles. Harry Osborn followed in the footsteps of his father and became the next Green Goblin. He blamed Peter for his father\\'s death. Harry later lost his memory after a fight with Spider-Man. Harry\\'s psychologist, <a href=\"../../bart-hamilton/29-34978/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bart Hamilton</a> attempted to take up the mantle of the Goblin himself but was killed by his own bomb while fighting Peter.</p><h3><b>Secret Wars and the Symbiote</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862547\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5324324324324\" data-width=\"370\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 370px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862547\"><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg 370w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Suit</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../../beyonder/29-10300/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beyonder</a> transported Spider-Man along with other heroes and villains to <a href=\"../../battleworld/34-51065/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Battleworld</a> to take place in the <a href=\"../../secret-wars/39-40978/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Wars</a>, an intergalactic battle between the world\\u2019s greatest heroes and villains. During the battle, Spider-Man\\u2019s suit was badly damaged and he needed a new one. Peter came upon a strange machine that produced a <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">black substance</a> which slithered over him and covered his entire body. This new black and white costume, similar to <a href=\"/arachne/4005-16197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Arachne\\'s</a> costume, replaced his old costume. Once the heroes won the battle, they were all transported back to Earth and Spider-Man kept on wearing the suit because it enhanced his strength, speed, and agility. He would start experiencing odd signs of fatigue and became even more concerned when he discovered that the suit produced organic webbing. He took the suit to <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reed Richards</a> who told him that it\\'s actually a <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">living alien symbiote</a>, which can only survive by bonding to a host and draining their life-force away. Reed used a sonic emitter to separate Peter from the suit. Spider-Man was now without a costume and <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm</a>, as part of a practical joke, gave Peter an old Fantastic Four costume with a paper bag for a mask and dubbed him the Bombastic Bag-Man. Admiring the black suit\\'s design, Spider-Man\\'s then-girlfriend and crime-fighting partner the <a href=\"/black-cat/4005-1479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1479\">Black Cat</a> made him a cloth version of the black costume which he would start using for a time. The symbiote made its way back to Peter and attempted to permanently bond with him, but Peter used the sounds of a church bell to seemingly destroy the suit. It survived and found a host in <a href=\"../../eddie-brock/29-6733/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eddie Brock</a> to become one of Spider-Man\\'s deadliest and most recurring foes, <a href=\"../../venom/29-1486/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Venom</a>.</p><h3><b>Death of Jean DeWolff</b></h3><p>A close friend of Peter\\'s, <a href=\"/jean-dewolff/4005-2471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2471\">Jean DeWolff</a> was killed by a criminal called the <a href=\"/sin-eater/4005-11206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11206\">Sin-Eater</a>. Spider-Man became determined to capture him before anyone else was hurt and so he teamed up with Daredevil, who also held a grudge against the criminal. After an encounter with Sin-Eater that left an innocent bystander harmed, Peter was drawn closer to the dark side. After saving Betty Brant from the criminal, Spider-Man was tempted to kill him but was stopped by <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>.

For years he was believed to have died after his initial encounter with the real Peter Parker. The clone, who is now calling himself <a href=\"../../scarlet-spider/29-6286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ben Reilly</a> spent years traveling the world as he knew there was no place for him in New York City again. When his aunt May was believed to be dying, Ben returned to New York and eventually met Peter Parker. At first the two fought and Peter saw Ben as a thread, but later on the two of them worked together, with Ben even taken over as Spider-man for some time when it was believed that Peter had lost his powers. It was also during this time that aunt May seemingly died of old age. Before she passed away, she told Peter that she had known about him being Spider-man for some time now. Years later, it would be revealed that it was not aunt May that had died, but a stand in that was the work of Norman Osborn. Peter remained out of super-heroin for some time, untill his powers seemingly returned and he and the Scarlet Spider fought side by side for some time. The story arc lasted for two years and ended with the death of Ben Reilly at the hands of a returning Norman Osborn who was revealed to be alive and has been pulling strings from the moment he was believed to have died. On that day, Peter felt to have lost a brother. Although Norman Osborn was defeated, it was far from the last thing that was heard from him. With his powers fully returned, Peter resumed his work as the Amazing Spider-Man once again.</p><h3>The Identity Crisis</h3><p>After this saga, the <a href=\"/spider-man-identity-crisis/4045-55684/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55684\">Identity Crisis</a> story takes place in which Spider-Man is accused by a returned Norman Osborn of murder and a bounty is put on his head. This is done by Norman Osborn, whom had cleared his name as a criminal when he proclaimed that he was not really the Green Goblin, but was set up by this criminal. He had taken over the Daily Bugle and put a price on Spider-Man\\'s head in the newspaper. This lead to a variate of bounty-hunters to attack Spider-Man. Feeling it to dangerous for himself and his loved ones to remain the hero he is, Peter retires from being Spider-Man and forms four different identities which he uses to keep on helping people and in the meantime clear his name. Eventually Peter\\'s name was cleared and he returned to being Spider-Man.</p><h3>Gathering of the Five</h3><p>It seemed that Spider-man was finally back on track, with his name cleared and his life finally looking a bit better than it had in recent months. Norman Osborn however kept being a disturbing presence to Peter and Mary Jane. He started a ritual known as the Gathering of the Five, with one person getting Ultimate power, one got death, one got insanity and so on. Norman thought he gained power, but it turned out that it was insanity that he got. He attacked and kidnapped Peter. While he was captive, Peter got the shock of a life-time. His aunt May was standing in front of him, alive and well. After Spider-man broke free and defeated Norman Osborn, seemingly for good, as he was taken to a mental hospital, Peter learned that it was in fact aunt May he found. Not a clone, not a hoax. Norman had apparently kidnapped May years ago, and had an actress surgically look like aunt May and play her part while she was dying. This was why \\'aunt May\\' knew about Peter being Spider-Man, she was hired by Norman Osborn to play her! Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four assured Peter it was his aunt. Peter saw this as a sign and stopped being Spider-Man altogether, finally living a good life with his aunt May and his wife Mary-Jane.</p><h3>A New Chapter in Life and a New Spider-Woman</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509302\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-ratio=\"1.1566820276498\" data-width=\"651\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 651px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509302\"><img alt=\"Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 651w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 553w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 651w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 553w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman</figcaption></figure><p>After Peter had his aunt returned, he decided to stop being Spider-man for good. He started living in a new apartment with his aunt May and wife Mary-Jane. All of New York was wondering where Spider-Man could have gone after his seemingly final battle with the Green Goblin. He would not even react to messages send by Peter\\'s good friend the Human Torch. Peter had found a job at a science-center where he did good work and stayed out of the superhero life, although it turned out that was harder then it seemed. It was at this time that a seemingly new Spider-Man appeared on the scene. It turned out that this was Mattie Franklin, a participant in the Gathering of the Five, whom got the gift of Power. She acted as Spider-man and later as Spider-Woman, when Peter finally accepted that he was needed as Spider-man and returned to the life as a superhero.</p><p>All seemed to go well again until Mary-Jane, whom had started acting again, was threatened by a stalker. It started with phone-calls, but when Mary-Jane took a plane, it exploded in mid-air and seemingly killed Mary-Jane. Peter, firstly stricken with grief, did not believe she had died. He knew it must have had something to do with the stalker, and Peter started a crusade to find out the truth. This brought him to Latveria and in a fight against the Hulk among others. Eventually, Peter learned that it was indeed the stalker that had faked Mary-Jane\\'s death and had held her captive during it all. The stalker was a mutant that absorbed all of Peter\\'s memories when he was saved by him during one of Spider-man\\'s fights on the streets of New York. The Stalker needed Mary-Jan for himself because of it and he felled he knew her. Spider-man managed to save Mary-Jane and defeat the Stalker. Mary-Jane however was traumatized by the experience and needed time of from her life as the wife of a superhero. The two parted ways for some time.</p><h3><b>A Death in the Family</b></h3><p>Norman Osborn broke out of jail and managed to clear his name of being the Green Goblin. After failing to convert Peter into his heir, he started to provoke Peter into killing him in a story called <a href=\"../../a-death-in-the-family/39-56294/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Death in the Family</a>. Norman was sick of his life and wanted to die at the hands of Spider-man. He tried to get Peter so mad that he would do this. First by releasing footage of Gwen\\'s death to the media, claiming that Gwen\\'s death was the result of Spider-Man\\'s selfish actions. To make matters worse, Norman forced a drunken Flash Thompson to have a car accident, causing him to go into a coma. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin meet up in one of Osborn\\'s warehouses where Spider-Man defeats the Goblin. Although he urged him to finish him off, Peter refused to play the Goblin\\'s game and proposed a truce. Norman accepts, but as he returns to one of his offices, he puts a gun in his mouth. He is however to afraid to pull the trigger.</p><h3>Ezekiel</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149541\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149541\"><img alt=\"Spider-man and Ezekiel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man and Ezekiel\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-man and Ezekiel</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-man meets a strange individual named Ezekiel, whom knows that he is truly Peter Parker, and warns him of a powerful enemy whom will try to kill him, known as Morlun.

It is at this time that aunt May enters the room and sees Peter as Spider-Man. The secret is finally out!

Daken attacks and uses his pheromones to shut down Peter\\'s senses, however Peter focuses on his spider-sense alone, and eventually defeats Daken by throwing him into an electrical machine that electrocutes and knocks out Daken. However, Harry reveals Spider-Man\\'s disguise in front of Osborn\\'s Avengers,(even though Norman had known it all along, and only wanted to ensure he had his son\\'s trust) and he was held captive and tortured by <a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\">Bullseye</a>.

After a loud knocking at his apartment door and he opens it only to see his estranged clone Kaine, beaten and bloodied. Before passing out, Kaine reveals to Peter that the \"Spiders\" are being hunted. A loud explosion is heard nearby his apartment and Peter goes to check it out only to see Arachne fighting off Ana and Alyosha Kravinoff. Peter, being weakened by the swine flu, struggles to put up a fight and manages to impale Alyosha on a broken pipe, gaining him time to retrieve Arachne and to escape. After retreating to Mattie Franklin\\'s apartment, they are approached by a dead Ezekiel. He then tells Spider-Man and Arachne that they have to save Arana from the clutches of the Kravinoff\\'s. As they finally reach her, they become outnumbered and defeated and Arachne and Arana are captured. Kaine eventually arrives to help out but was too late to make a difference.

Spider-man then gets ambushed and killed by the Kravinoff\\'s. With Kraven finally back from the dead, he shows his anger at Sasha by confirming that the blood was not that of the real Spider-Man but of his clone Kaine. When Peter awakens, he finds Kaine\\'s body in a coffin with a note reading \"Hunt me\" and his black costume lying beside the coffin. Spider-Man begins to hunt the Kravinoff\\'s one by one, first taking out Chameleon and nearly killing Vladimir with a giant tombstone before dodging a point-blank shot from Alyosha\\'s rifle. Spider-man than appears on the roof of the mansion and attacks Sasha, leaving the mark of Kaine on her face (using his finger\\'s abilities to rip the skin off of her face) in revenge for the death of his clone and \"brother\". Spider-Man and Kraven then proceed to engage into battle and the fight proves to be completely one-sided as Peter goes all out with the intentions of killing Kraven for the murders of his friends. As he is about to deliver the killing blow to Kraven with his own spear, Arachne (As the new Madame Web) appears and shows Spider-man a grim future that would follow if he decided to murder Kraven.

As Spider-Man, Peter has become a much more respected member of the Super-Hero community. Additionally, thanks to <a href=\"/marla-jameson/4005-10671/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10671\">Marla Jameson</a>, Peter has become a think tank scientist at <a href=\"/horizon-labs/4020-57110/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57110\">Horizon Labs</a> under the employ of known scientist <a href=\"/max-modell/4005-74419/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74419\">Max Modell</a>. <a href=\"/hobgoblin/4005-7605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\">Roderick Kingsley</a> is murdered by a crazed <a href=\"/phil-urich/4005-2246/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2246\">Phil Urich</a> who takes up the mantle of the Hobgoblin. He takes on the mission Kingpin initially assigned to Kingsley, which involved stealing a metal called reverbium from Horizon Labs. On Peter\\'s first day at Horizon Labs, the lab is attacked by the new Hobgoblin who is using new weapons. After a fight with Spider-Man, Phil steals the reverbium and delivers it to Kingpin who allows Phil to work for him. Spider-Man designs himself a new Stealth Suit (Which has the ability to turn invisible.) to overcome Phil\\'s Goblin Laugh which incapacitated him in their previous encounter. Along with the Black Cat, he attempts to take down Kingpin and Hobgoblin and steal back the reverbium. At Fisk Towers, Spider-Man and the Black Cat fight the Hobgoblin, Kingpin and his Hand Ninjas. The reverbium is destroyed along with Fisk Towers, and Hobgoblin and Kingpin escape. But despite everything, Peter is now living a life with his dignity intact. He now has a new girlfriend, a new apartment and a proud Aunt May and Jay Sr. Part 2 <a href=\"/alistair-smythe/4005-6292/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6292\">Alistair Smythe</a> and his Spider-Slayers are back and taking aim at Mayor J.

Smythe returns Mac Gargan to his <a href=\"/mac-gargan/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion</a> identity and attacks the launch site where John is flying the Vertex shuttle into orbit which will meet up with a <a href=\"/horizon-labs/4020-57110/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57110\">Horizon Labs</a> space station. Spider-Man appears and web lines to a shuttle that just took off. Smythe has locked down the controls and rigged its booster rockets to explode before it leaves the atmosphere. To make matters worse, the evolved Scorpion appears to kill Spider-Man. But with secret help from Otto Octavius Spider-Man saves John. He gets help from the New Avengers in defending Jonah but Smythe sends his <a href=\"/army-of-insects/4060-58079/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58079\">Insect Army</a> after Jonah\\'s loved ones. But Spidey and his friends cannot hurt the Insect Army, they can barely even touch them, as Smythe gave them their own spider-sense. Peter with the help from Max Modell creates the spider-sense disruptor. He is given the detonator and must be far from the center of the \"explosion\" or his sense might be also caught in in. But during the second fight against the Scorpion, Scorpion destroys the detonator, and Spider-Man must do it manually. And when he detonates it he is caught in the epicenter. The Insect Army has lost the spider-sense, but so has Spider-Man. After Spider-Man defeats the Scorpion, he goes to check on the others but Smythe suddenly appears and Spider-Man had not seen it coming due to not having spider-sense, but <a href=\"/marla-jameson/4005-10671/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10671\">Marla Jameson</a> did.

Jackal is revealed to be working on a scheme, recruiting several spider-powered criminals for some kind of project. Later, Peter and Carlie Cooper are talking when Carlie reveals she has spider-powers. When news of several hundreds of New Yorkers having manifested spider-powers reaches them, Carlie web swings away to help. Peter then pretends to be another random spider-powered New Yorker and defends New York against the spider-powered villains, along with the Avengers. Anti-Venom is seen curing people of their spider-powers, as he showed the ability to do so in New Ways to Die. Jackal is seen working on the Spider-King, filled with tiny embryos. Horizon Labs and Mr Fantastic work on finding a cure while the Avengers keep Manhattan quarantined to stop the virus from spreading. While at an lab, Peter and Carlie are attacked by Chance, Scorcher, and White Rabbit, who also have spider-powers. Peter manages to defeat them using his training from Shang-Chi. Jackal has the battle taped and gives it to Tarantula to study, as he will soon be \\'tested\\'. Reed Richards finally develops a vaccine that stops people from gaining spider-powers, but cannot cure those already infected. J. Jonah Jameson discovers that he, too, has gained spider powers. Anti-Venom continues curing people, however Madame Web faints from the massive excess of spiders accessing the \\'web of life\\'. Carlie meets up with Spider-Man, when they attempt to take down Shocker, who has grown 6 extra arms. After taking off his mask, they find that his face is slowly mutating into a spider\\'s face, and his body is doing the same. Carlie starts to mutate as well.The Spider-Queen tells Jackal that the people of New York will soon become spiders, and she will own New York.</p><p>Reed and Horizon finally develop a cure to the virus, based off of Anti-Venom\\'s symbiotic abilities, able to kill the virus and reverse the mutation, turning the spiders into normal people again. However, the Spider-Queen sends Tarantula to poison the serum; Peter fights him off, and Reed and Horizon manage to give Peter back his spider sense. Peter, with his full power, defeats Tarantula and throws him into a pool of the serum. The serum cures Tarantula of his degeneration and even the Spider-Queen\\'s mind control; the healthy Kaine offers to help Peter. Madame Web and Spider-Queen are both reconnected to the Web. Spider-Queen thus becomes a Spider-Goddess.</p><p>Spider-Queen has now evolved into a massive, spider-like monster, drawing strength from all infected New Yorkers. Mary Jane realizes that, because of her long relationship to Peter, she has some immunity against the disease, gaining spider-powers but not the subsequent mutations. Peter gives Kaine the Stealth Suit (immune to the Queen\\'s sonic attacks) and Kaine goes to attack the Queen. Peter and Mary Jane gather several octobots, outfitting each with several doses of the cure, making them go out to cure people. Peter then connects with the antennae on top of the Empire State Building, curing many people at once, while Mary Jane fights off the spider-like creatures attacking them. Kaine jumps inside the Queen\\'s mouth, killing her by reflecting her sonic scream on her insides. The Jackal uses a disguise to get samples of the Queen\\'s bone marrow for future experiments.</p><p>The following day, Peter learns from Doctor Strange that the psychic blindspot put in place to defend his secret identity has been destroyed, because of a viral video of spider-powered Peter defending people. Carlie deduces who Peter is and promptly breaks up with him for lying to her. Mary Jane admits her love for Peter, and Peter administers an antidote to her. The two look up at the Empire Stats Building, which is projecting a red and blue light, thanking Spider-Man for his heroic deeds.</p><h3>Ends of the Earth</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2376781\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.76848484848485\" data-width=\"1650\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2376781\"><img alt=\"Mind Controlled Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 1650w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mind Controlled Avengers\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 1650w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mind Controlled Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Doc Ock knows that he is soon going to die. Before his death, he wants to be remembered as the man who saved the world by stopping the Greenhouse effect. Spider-man doesn\\'t believe Octavius, however, so he gathers the Avengers in order to discover Ock\\'s true plan and put a stop to it. Unknown to Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus was well prepared for the fight and the Sinister Six subdue the Avengers. Doc Ock is about to kill Spider-Man, but Silver Sable comes to the rescue. She saves Peter and the Black Widow, and they set off to Octavius\\' manufacturing plants. There they encounter the Sandman, but they manage to beat him. Doc Ock asked the nations to capture Spider-Man (his position enabled him to do so) and he also called on many villains to take down Spider-Man. Parker knows that he can\\'t stop Otto alone, so he asks other heroes to destroys Ock\\'s facilities. When Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable reach the main base in Romania, Doctor Octopus activates his satellites and every area that faces the sun explodes. It later turns out that this was only an illusion created by Mysterio, rather than reality. Spider-Man captures Mysterio and finds out that Doc Ock is hiding in Guatemala, but after Pete, Silver, and Natasha arrive at the site they\\'re attacked by a group of mind controlled Avengers. Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable gain an edge because the mind controlled Avengers are unable to fight as well as they would normally, and the Avengers are able to return to their senses thanks to Mysterio\\'s technology. Black Widow was knocked out during the fight, however. Doctor Octopus launched several missiles so the Red Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor try to put an end to it. Mysterio reveals that Octavius\\' base is underwater, so Spider-Man and Sable resolve to put an end to Otto\\'s plot once and for all. They unfortunately meet Rhino on their way, and he catches Sable and begins choking her in the water. With her final breath, Silver tells Peter to leave her and stop Otto. Spider-man is desperate to help her, but he knows that he\\'s running out of time and is left with no choice. Spider-Man finally finds and battles Octavius, but he is eventually caught in the Doc\\'s metal tentacles. With Parker trapped, Octavius reveals that his plan is to scar the earth, to be worse than Hitler and the other monsters, and in that way be remembered. Octopus removes his armor in order to activate his master plan, but Spider-Man tells Doc Ock that he had made an error in allowing himself to be distracted just long enough for Peter to break free. Spider-Man saves both Doctor Octopus and the world, but at the cost of Silver Sable\\'s life.</p><h3><b>No Turning Back</b></h3><p>It\\'s been three weeks since spider-man foiled Doc Ock\\'s plan and now Peter is invited to MJ\\'s, which is Mary Jane\\'s Club, but he is still under the weather because he was not able to prevent Silver Sables death, but while Peter is \"having fun\" at the party Carlie calls and tells Spider-man to come meet her at the cemetery. Spider-Man arrives and Carlie tells him that the grounds keeper saw a pale man digging the grave of Billie Connors with his bare hands and then vanishing into the dark with the body. Spider-Man instantly realized that this pale powerful man was Morbius and he goes to face him at Horizon labs. Spider-Man, disgusted by Morbius\\' actions, starts to attack him, but eventually stops when Michael explains that the reason he dug up the grave was to find a cure for the Lizard, and he tells Peter that he has already accomplished his goal. Spider-Man, hearing this, plans an attack on the Lizard and the confronts him in the sewers and fights him for a long period for time, but finaly Morbius and Spider-Man stab the Lizard with enough hypodermic harpoons for Max to bring Connor\\'s back. But the Lizard is still in control, even in Kurt\\'s body. The Lizard awakens Morbius\\' violent vampire side, with the smell of blood. And while Spider-Man was distracted with Morbius, Connors created the new serum that will turn him into the Lizard again, but this serums turns everyone into lizards except Connors himself, so while testing this serum Connors turns the entire Horizon Labs crew into Lizards. When he finally created the serum for himself, it turned him into a new version of the Lizard. When Spider-Man comes after capturing Morbius, Carlie tells him what has happened. Spidey creates a new cure and a battle ensures between Spider-Man and the Lizard. When Spider-Man stabs the Lizard with a harpoon filled with the cure, nothing happens, the cure doesn\\'t work. Only at the end we see that the cure has actually worked and now Connors\\' mind is secretly in control of the Lizard\\'s body.</p><h3><b>Alpha</b></h3><p>A teen outcast Andy Maguire went on a trip from his school to Horizon Labs, where Peter Parker was holding an experiment. Tiberius Stone, not liking Peter, sabotages the experiment, and Andy is hit with a ray of Peter Particles. Soon after he discovers he has super-powers. When he is examined by top greatest superhuman specialists, Reed Richards, Tony Stark, Henry Pym and Hank McCoy, they discover that he has energy projection, flight, super speed, super strength and force field, but his limitation is he can control only one power at a time. Reed tells Peter that he had discovered these particles, but didn\\'t publish his work, because he considered the particles too powerful and dangerous. He then assigns Alpha as Spider-Man\\'s sidekick. Alpha is however very careless and eventually quits working with Spider-Man and goes solo. Spider-Man decides then that there should be Alpha no more! Soon when earth is under attack from Terminus, Alpha is called from Captain America to fight him. During the fight Alpha behaves most irresponsible and almost destroys planes flying in the air. Though Alpha defeats Terminus, Peter observes that Terminus\\' staff can redirect Alpha energy. Then Spider-Man calls Alpha for another \"analysis\" and uses the tech acquired from the Terminus to strip Andy of his Alpha power, leaving him as nobody again.</p><h3>Dying Wish</h3><p>Using a modified Octo-bot, Octavius successfully transfers his consciousnesses into Spider-Man, leaving him with Peter\\'s memories and body and Peter Parker in Doctor Octopus\\'s dying one. After leaving Peter for dead Otto begins to take on Spider-Man\\'s life as his own. Peter eventually took control of the golden Octo-bot and using one of Doc Ock\\'s own contingency plans had <a href=\"/scorpion/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion</a>, <a href=\"/hydro-man/4005-4457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4457\">Hydro-Man</a> and <a href=\"/trapster/4005-4328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4328\">Trapster</a> free himself from the <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> prison <a href=\"/the-raft/4020-50736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">The Raft</a>. It was then that Peter tried to redo the body switch with Ock who had taken precautions to keep that from happening. Peter instead had Otto relive all of Peter\\'s memories showing Dr. Octopus how much he had wasted his life. As a result of Peter\\'s personality grafted to his own, Dr. Octopus decided to continue on as Spider-Man and make up for his past mistakes as the Superior Spider-man.</p><h3><b>Superior Spider-Man</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2903877\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5177777777778\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2903877\"><img alt=\"SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 900w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 632w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 900w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 632w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?</figcaption></figure><p>However, Parker still existed within Doctor Octopus\\'s mind in the memories that he absorbed. The consciousness intent on stopping the villain and reclaiming his life, tries to influence Octavius, but fails to do so in any more than the slightest of ways. Parker\\'s remnant also inadvertently causes Otto to share Peter\\'s genuine love for Mary Jane Watson, and so pushes her away for her own safety. After Otto used a brain scanner to treat a young girl\\'s brain injury, he decided to use the device on himself to discover Parker\\'s presence within his mind. A mental battle ensues between himself and Parker, which Otto seemingly wins, erasing Peter\\'s memories.</p><p>After Octavius tries to retrieve some of Parker\\u2019s memories in an attempt to solve a revirbium related problem, Peter\\'s consciousness begins to re-emerge, having somehow escaped the mind-purge. When Otto is possessed by the Venom Symbiote and is unable to free himself of it, Peter\\'s consciousness again emerges and breaks the Symbiote\\'s hold over Dr. Octopus, enabling Flash Thompson to call it back to him.</p><p>Peter Parker\\'s re-emerged consciousness begins to explore his Mindscape, discovering the world is now a large empty space, with only the very few key memories left. Recalling that he\\'s more than Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man, he declares that Otto had made a big mistake in leaving the memories that define him and promises to find a way to regain the control of his body. Continuing to explore the Mindscape for clues into reclaiming his body from Doctor Octopus, he makes a note that only 31 pieces of his memories are left and wonders what he can do with them. Just then, he stumbles upon the memory of his fight with the Green Goblin at the Brooklyn Bridge, wonders why Doctor Octopus is probing into this. Deciding to delve into Doctor Octopus\\'s memories for a way out, he is overwhelmed by the amount of memories and struggles to hold on. He sees a bright light and witnesses the moment of Otto Octavius\\'s birth. Peter Parker\\'s consciousness struggles to fight against the deluge of Doctor Octopus\\' memories, but it proves too much and he convinces himself that he is Doctor Octopus merging with Otto\\'s memories.</p><h2>Personal Data</h2><h3>Characteristics</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 5\\'10\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 167 lbs. 11.93 stones 75.75kg</li><li><b>Eye Color:</b> Hazel</li><li><b>Hair Color:</b> Brown</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Identity:</b> Secret</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Forest Hills, New York</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> U.S.A.</li><li><b>Education:</b> College graduate (biophysics major), doctorate studies in biochemistry (incomplete)</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Freelance photographer, former assistant high school coach, former science teacher, scientific researcher, Horizon Labs employee</li><li><b>Known Relatives</b>: <a href=\"/richard-parker/4005-15261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15261\">Richard Parker</a> (father, deceased), <a href=\"/mary-parker/4005-15262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15262\">Mary Parker</a> (mother, deceased), <a href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Benjamin Parker</a> (uncle, deceased), <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">May Parker</a> (aunt), Will Fitzpatrick (grandfather), <a href=\"/amy-reilly/4005-65796/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65796\">Amy Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/amanda-reilly/4005-66173/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66173\">Amanda Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/alexa-reilly/4005-65797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65797\">Alexa Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/scarlet-spider/4005-6286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6286\">Benjamin Reilly</a> (Scarlet Spider, clone, deceased), <a href=\"/kaine/4005-8667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Kaine</a> (clone), <a href=\"/spidercide/4005-25666/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25666\">Spidercide</a> (clone).</li></ul><h2><b>Powers and Abilities</b></h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026841\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5145454545455\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026841\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 550w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 550w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider, granted to him from an irradiated Common House Spider (Achaearanea tepidariorum) which bit Peter Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain frequencies of radiation and received a final, lethal dose during Parker\\'s attendance of the exhibition.</p><p>The radioactive, complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider\\'s blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within Parker, granting him superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and numerous arachnid-like abilities. Like many superhuman powers, the effectiveness of Spider-Man\\'s abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story.</p><p><b>Spider-Sense</b></p><p>Spider-Man has many abilities but the most amazing of all is his uncanny Spider-Sense. It is a tingling sensation on the back of his skull that acts as a \"sixth sense\" and it manifests when he is around or targeted by incoming dangers. It\\'s a precognition ability that is pheromone based and is similar to Daredevil\\'s radar sense, increasing his reaction time and awareness. The spider-sense can manifest when Peter\\'s secret identity is about to be compromised. It also manifests when he encounters someone who might pose a threat to him or to someone he cares about. For example, when Peter saw his roommate <a href=\"/michele-gonzales/4005-62208/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62208\">Michele Gonzales</a> with one of her clients, his spider-sense warned him that the client was actually a thug who was participating in a super-villain gladiatorial contest. While the spider-sense cannot discern the specific nature of the impending threat, he can identify which direction it is coming from and the severity of the danger by the intensity of the spider-sense. Sometimes it becomes strong enough to be painful. When Spider-Man is blinded, the Spider-Sense works as another set of eyes to avoid bumping into objects. When <a href=\"/daken/4005-42501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\">Daken</a> used his pheromones on Spider-Man, Peter closed his eyes and relied only on his spider-sense to defeat his foe because the pheromones corrupted his sight. A similar situation happened when Peter fought the new Vulture who blinded him with acid in the eyes. Spider-Man relied on this ability to survive this fight. Of course his Spider-Sense is a great help when he faces people in the dark. This has been proven in his fight with <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>. The spider-sense can lose its effectiveness when Peter is too distracted, tired or when he chooses to ignore it although its difficult to do so because it is heavily linked to his reflexes. There were also times that his spider-sense wasn\\'t very effective due to the Spidey\\'s previous lack of formal training, but this has since has been largely rectified since learning the Way of the Spider. Under extreme circumstances, such as fighting in the dark or against powerful characters, Spidey has often used his spectacular spider-sense in a more effective and better way. The Spider-Sense also gave him his own free-style form of combat, allowing him to go head-to-head with the best martial artists in the Marvel Universe and his H2H skill has improved significantly since merging his Way of the Spider training with his Spider-Sense. Furthermore, the Spider-Sense also allows Spider-Man to detect certain radio frequencies on which his spider tracers\\' signals are based upon. During Spider-Man\\'s first encounter with the Chameleon, the villain used a certain radio frequency to send a message to Spider-Man via his spider-sense. The Spider-Sense, combined with his speed and reflexes allows Spider-Man to dodge almost all conventional attacks. Due to the similar nature of their powers, Spider-Man is unable to sense other \"Spiders\", such as Ben Reilly, Ezekiel, and Kaine. During the Big Time story, Spider-Man used a device to block Alistair Smythe\\'s minions\\' enhanced senses, but also disabled his own Spider-Sense. After the events of Spider-Island, Peter regained this ability.</p><h4><b>Superhuman Strength</b></h4><p>Spider-Man has the proportionate strength of a spider, thus allowing him to press 10 tons without effort and much more when under stress. His attacks are so strong; they could kill a normal person- Spider-Man has to pull his punches or kicks when not fighting foes with similar or higher strength levels to avoid fatalities. His strength also extends to his feet, allowing him to leap great lengths and attain a heights of much greater three stories with one powerful jump. Spidey\\'s strength has made him capable of going toe-to-toe with opponents including <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Doctor Octopus</a>, <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom</a> and <a href=\"/rhino/4005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">Rhino</a>. He has even held his own against powerful heroes such as Iron Man and the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>. It\\'s also shown that Spider-Man can break free from Doctor Octopus\\'s nearly indestructible arms albeit with much effort, although this was due to the Sinister Six suit enhancing his strength. Spidey\\'s strength and durability also give him incredible stamina allowing him to exert himself beyond the limits of humans as his body produces less fatigue toxins. He was able to fight Morlun continually for many hours, and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans. After his encounter with the Queen, Spider-Man\\'s strength had been increased to the point where he has become able to lift over 15 tons without effort and after the Other story arc he was able to lift at least 20 tons without effort. During that time, he wore an Iron Spider costume designed for him by Tony Stark which increased his strength further allowing him to lift over 25 tons without effort. He has stopped wearing the Iron Spider costume after the Civil War and his enhanced strength was erased by <a href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a> after the One More Day storyline. Spider-man\\'s best strength feats tend to come during periods of emotional duress- for example in a fight with Iron Man 2020, where when a boy was injured mid fight, an enraged Spider-Man jumped up to his flying height and hit him with such force the foe was sent flying hundreds of feet into a building, which was destroyed on impact. Another instance was when he lifted a segment of the Daily Bugle, after the building was attacked by the Green Goblin. In both cases, he didn\\'t have any enhancements from the Queen or the Other.</p><h4><b>Superhuman Speed, Agility, Flexibility and Reflexes</b></h4><p>Spider-Man possesses the uncanny speed, agility and reflexes of a spider. He can move at a speed that surpasses that of the finest human athletes. This is particularly evident over short distances. He has frequently speed-blitzed many foes- including those with enhanced speed and reflexes, moving so fast that he leaves blurring after images. He has been described as moving with the speed of machine gun fire, moving faster than the eye can follow, and moved so fast that Daredevil (who has enhanced reflexes and senses) could barely register him, and was unable react to a punch he was knew Spider-Man was going to land. Over longer distances, his speed seems less pronounced, but he was still able to outrun Kraven and his cheetahs (both of whom can run at over 60 mph) and has easily outran speeding cars. However, this could be due to his preference of Web-Slinging over longer distances than due to an inability to maintain higher levels of speed over longer distances. Spider-Man can easily perform the most complicated acrobatic moves as his body is extremely flexible, giving him agility, balance and bodily coordination that surpass those of the finest human athletes. Spider-Man is considered the best when it comes to balance in the Marvel Universe, as he possesses excellent equilibrium allowing him to balance himself on any object. Even some of the most agile street-level heroes like Captain America, Daredevil and <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> are nowhere near Spider-Man\\'s level of speed and agility. Spider-Man\\'s reflexes are forty times greater than peak level humans, and when combined with his Spider-Sense, speed and agility, enable him to dodge bullets and other conventional projectiles with ease. During the Grim Hunt storyline, he even dodged sniper rifle fire at point blank range- after the bullet had been fired.</p><p><b>Superhuman Durability</b></p><p>Spider-Man also has incredible durability to blunt trauma as his body is much tougher than that of a normal person. He can withstand such levels of damage and punishment that would kill non-super powered individuals. For example he has frequently taken blows from characters with high levels of superhuman strength (Hulk, Venom, Rhino, Puma, Green Goblin etc) without sustaining significant injury. He has also survived the force of having a building collapse on him multiple times. This durability extends to falling from great heights. For example, he was once knocked through three buildings by Mr Negative before falling multiple stories to the ground, yet still remained conscious. His durability to blunt trauma also extends to explosive forces, and he has taken explosions with the force of a hand grenade and recovered nearly instantly in a recent fight with the Juggernaut. In the Sins Past Storyline he tanked a building destroying explosion, but was significantly weakened afterwards. The toughness of Spider-Man is such that he often rolls with the blows of punches thrown by non-powered foes to avoid injuring them- when he once decided to tense his abdominal muscles against the blows of a trained boxer, the boxer broke his wrists. Scorpion once described Spider-Man\\'s body \"as being as hard as concrete\".</p><p>However, Spider-Man\\'s durability isn\\'t nearly as formidable against penetrative forces. He can be hurt by knives and bullets much in the same way that normal humans can, and has been rendered unconscious by a tracking bullet which pierced his shoulder. Normal bullets also tend to cause Spider-Man problems as well. When he lost his Spider-Sense and faced a villain known as Massacre who utilized multiple weaponry and traps, Spider-Man decided to make a bulletproof suit from tech at Horizon labs. However, if injured by such forces, Spider-Man healing factor allows him to heal much faster than normal humans can.</p><p><b>Wall Crawling</b></p><p>Spider-Man\\'s exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of inter-atomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell\\'s normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man\\'s body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger. Limits to this ability seem to be psychosomatic, and the full nature of this ability has yet to be established. Spider-man utilizes this ability in his locomotion across New-York, but also has the ability to use it offensively, in a manner resembling the Mark of Kaine. Spider-Man rarely uses this ability though, due to its brutal and disfiguring effects. It also works differently, ripping off layers of skin and muscle, rather than burning it as Kaine does via the HCL secreted through his palms.</p><h4><b>Organic Webbing</b></h4><p>There are different areas in different comic book universes where Spider-Man has organic webbing, which is often shown as being stronger and more long lasting than his synthetic variants. Spider Man has organic webbing from the movies (of course) and 616 (end of civil war, back in black, etc.) Spider Man also has organic webbing in the 2099 universe. It seems the strength of his webbing relates directly to his health.</p><h4><b>Superhuman Stamina</b></h4><p>Spider-Man\\'s advanced musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for many hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. He once fought Morlun for many hours continuously, and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans.</p><h4><b>Regenerative Healing Factor</b></h4><p>Spider-Man has a limited healing factor. While not on Wolverine\\'s level, it is sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days. After getting his powers, he soon found that his eyesight was repaired, discarding his glasses. During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder, Spider-Man is rendered completely blind, however after about 2 days his sight was perfect, albeit sensitive for about a day after. In another instance, he suffered multiple broken bones, trauma, and blood loss when he was defeated by the Rhino, but was fine in the next issue.</p><h4><b>Foreign Chemical Resistance</b></h4><p>Due to his accelerated metabolism, Spider-Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly. During an encounter with the Swarm, Spider-Man was incapacitated by thousands of bee stings, but recovered in less than 24 hours. In another example, he was able to recover from the effects of gases nearly instantly. His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies, but is typically significantly higher than normal. Spider-Man\\'s unique physiology even allowed him to recover from the effects of vampirism. Spider-Man was able to recover completely from acid being spat into his eyes by the new Vulture; Jimmy Natale, although the extent of the damage may have been restricted due to his superhuman durability. However, Spider-Man has the normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.</p><h4>Superhuman Sight</h4><p>Spider-Man also seems to have at least some degree of Super-Human sight, at least in order to assist his Superhuman speed, reflexes and agility. Ever since obtaining his powers, he has not needed his glasses, and has frequently pulled off impressive aiming feats with his webbing, although this is assisted with his Spider-Sense. Perhaps most impressively, during Spider-Island, a depowered Hercules with Spider-Man\\'s power-set said he could see bullets in slow motion.</p><h4><b>Skills</b></h4><p>On top of his spider-given powers Peter is of genius level intelligence. It has even been stated that Peter scored as high on some of the same testing scores as <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> did when he was Peter\\'s age. He is especially gifted in the sciences such as mechanics, biology and physics. This has become particularly apparent during his time working at Horizon Labs, where he was able to create a device to drain Alpha of his powers in less than 24 hours.</p><p>He has built many devices in his career as Spider-Man and is a skilled photographer and teacher. He has developed a unique style of combat through the years. Spider-Man, even before his training from Shang-Chi, has gone toe to toe with even the best marvel fighters. His spider-sense alone is like a close combat expert and combined with Spider-Man\\'s reflexes and physical attributes, make it very difficult for Street-levelers to defeat him when he is not holding back.</p><p>Upon approaching the Spider-Island arc, Peter felt vulnerable with the lack of his spider sense. He began training under Shang Chi to create his own unique martial arts style to make up for his lack of spider sense called the \"Way of the Spider\". It was then revealed that Shang Chi was instructed by the new Madam Web (Julia Carpenter the former Arachne and Spider-Woman) to secretly prepare Peter for a future threat (Spider-Island). This style consists of among other things, hitting pressure points with Spider Strength, and striking with Spider Speed. This new martial art has considerably improved Spider-Man\\'s H2H capabilities, and so far he has stalemated Julia Carpenter and effortlessly defeated 3 spider-powered individuals in a few seconds during Spider-Island. When he regained his Spider-Sense, he defeated a mutated Kaine who was considerably stronger and quicker than him, and effortlessly trumped a mind controlled Spider-Woman, in handful of blows and kicks.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><h4><b>Web-Shooters</b></h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104255\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2269938650307\" data-width=\"326\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 326px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104255\"><img alt=\"Spidey\\'s web-shooters broken down\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" data-width=\"521\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg 326w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey\\'s web-shooters broken down\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg 326w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" data-width=\"521\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey\\'s web-shooters broken down</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps, Spider-Man\\'s most famous piece of equipment is his self built <a href=\"/web-shooters/4055-42426/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42426\">web-shooters</a> which allow him to shoot sticky ropes of webbing which he uses to swing from building to building. They are a pair of special wrist devices of Peter\\'s own design that contain a material that mixes with air to web-like material. They can be used in many different ways by varying the pressure and adjusting the nozzles of the spinnerets. They can take the form of strong thin lines, as fine quick spreading lines, or as a thick adhesive liquid. Spider-Man can either use the webbing as web-gloves to protect his hands, as a Web-Parachute, an air-proof Web-Dome, a Web-Shield that offers protection from bullets and energy blasts, as small \"web-bullets\" that bounce off opponents, use the webbing to ensnare an opponent, tie foes up with a rope and hang them upside down from vertical poles, pulling his foes towards him, or shoot them in any direction he chooses Spider-Man\\'s primary means of transportation is by the use of his webbing to swing around the city. He shoots a strand of webbing to a high location, like the edge of a building, and pushes his body towards any direction he chooses while holding on to the web, allowing him to traverse at an accelerated speed. This artificial webbing lasts for an hour before fading away. More recently he has evolved biological web shooters that spray webbing from his forearms but this power has been erased by Mephisto after the One More Day storyline.</p><h4><b>Utility Belt</b></h4><p>Spider-Man wears a belt under his costume that contains a built-in <a href=\"../../spider-signal/18-56597/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Signal</a>. He uses it as either an unconventional light source or as a way to intimidate lesser villains. The belt also contains spare web cartridges, tracers, the camera and his mask when not in costume.</p><h4><b>Camera</b></h4><p>Spider-Man possesses his father\\'s automatic camera which zones in on the spider symbol on Spider-Man\\'s chest. It takes photos whenever movement is made in front of it. He would place the camera in a certain spot and springs into action in front of it, allowing him to take photos of himself. As Spider-Man he uses the camera to capture his heroic exploits to then sell the photos to the <a href=\"../../daily-bugle/65-40822/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daily Bugle</a>.</p><h4><b>Spider-Tracer</b></h4><p>The <a href=\"../../spider-tracer/18-55656/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Tracer</a> is a typical tracker that is shaped liked a spider and is aerodynamic for flight. The tracers are very small so it will not be noticed when attached to a person. The tracers contain a special radio frequency that his Spider-Sense can detect. He usually uses the tracers to track objects or people via his Spider-Sense within a 100 mile radius. Spider-Man fires the tracers at high velocity using his web-shooters and he has them coated with webbing in order for them to be firmly attached to their target. Since Peter lost his Spider-Sense, the use of the Spider-Tracers is rendered obsolete since he can only track them using his enhanced senses.</p><h4><b>Mask</b></h4><p>The white areas in Spider-Mans eye cut-outs on his mask are really clever plastic lenses of the two-way mirror type. He can see out very clearly, but no one can see in. Therefore, he can never be recognized by the color of his eyes. These ingenious plastic lenses also protect his eyes from dust, dirt, and the glare of the sun. Spider-Man\\'s colorful head-mask conceals his facial features and expressions and also effectively muffles his voice, making it unrecognizable. When using the Iron Spider-Man suit, it changed his voice in many ways. When Spider-Man became an Avenger, a special comm-link was outfitted into his mask allowing him to communicate with his fellow Avengers as well as others.</p><h4><b>Spider-Mobile</b></h4><p>The <a href=\"/spider-mobile/4055-15441/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15441\">Spider-Mobile</a> would first appear in The Amazing Spider-Man #130 in 1974. Spider-Man would be approached by Corona Motors who offers him a non-polluting vehicle in which they wanted him to promote. However, Peter turned it down and approaches his friend <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm</a> to create their own vehicle. They customized a dune buggy to have web-launchers and a spider-signal. It could also be disguised as a regular car so that no one would suspect that he was Spider-Man. Spider-Man would put it into action but it is quickly wrecked because <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio</a> tricked Peter into driving it off a pier. Later the Tinkerer would be able to recover the wrecked dune buggy and re-modify it to be able to drive up walls and to drive itself. The <a href=\"/tinkerer/4005-3144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3144\">Tinkerer</a> sent it to fight Spider-Man, in which he would barely defeat his own car.</p><h4>Equipment since working at Horizon Labs</h4><p>At Horizons Labs, the combination of a well paying job and access to numerous tech has allowed Peter to expand on the equipment he uses. So far he has developed a Spider-Glider, Thermodynamic Foam, Cryo Pellets, voice activated web-shooters and various types of webbing, including magnetic and acidic variants. Many of the equipment have usage in day-to-day usage as well- for example the cryo pellet technology was used to help keep organs and limbs viable for longer periods of time. The Thermodynamic foam also has use in the stopping and prevention of fires.</p><p><b><i>Spider-bots</i></b></p><p>Dock ock created specific spectators which keep watch of new york, saving spider-mans the trouble to patrol.</p><h2><b>Costumes</b></h2><p>Spider-Man has changed his costume many times but would always return to his classic and most well known look which has varied sometimes. He has had many memorable costumes, including the Black &amp; White symbiote suite, the Red &amp; Gold Iron Spider suit, the Identity Crisis costumes, the Scarlet Spider costume, the White &amp; Blue Armored Spider suit, the Bag-Man costume and recently he has started wearing a black &amp; green costume. You can view several of Spider-Man\\'s costumes in his costume gallery.</p><p>It is Spider-Man\\'s original and main look that has defined Spider-Man since his first appearance. Although it has seen many variations, it has remained one of Spider-Man\\'s essential traits. During Spidey\\'s early appearances, the costume was black &amp; red with blue shadings. In later issues, the colors change and they become red &amp; blue with black shading but some artists use the black color to give the character more depth. Also, Spider-Man was portrayed having webbing underneath his armpits that extended from his wrist to his waist. Over time, the under-arm webbing has shrank and some artists decided to draw Spidey without the webbing although it still appeared in some modern appearances.</p><h3><b>Black Suit</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-100577\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5125\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-100577\"><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" data-width=\"423\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" data-width=\"423\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Suit</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man discovered the symbiote costume during the <a href=\"/secret-wars/4045-40978/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40978\">Secret Wars</a> and it became his primary costume until he discovered that it was an alien feeding on him. With it, he had an unlimited supply of webbing, and the suit could mimic his civilian clothing. It didn\\'t, contrary to popular belief, enhance his powers. After meeting with Mr Fantastic, he decided it must be destroyed and would later get rid of it using the sounds of a church bell. It would later bond with Eddie Brock to form the deadly villain known as Venom. The Black Cat would later give Spidey a cloth version of the black suit which he would start wearing for a time, switching between it and the red &amp; blue costume. After the <a href=\"/kravens-last-hunt/4045-43327/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43327\">Kraven\\'s last Hunt</a> story and the appearance of Venom for the first time, Mary Jane urged Peter to stop wearing the costume because it reminded her of those traumatizing events. During the Back In Black story, after Aunt May was shot by a sniper, a darkness filled Spider-Man\\'s heart like never before. He wore the black costume to show this dark side, becoming much more ruthless towards enemies (using torture for example). Peter attempted to infiltrate Stark Tower to stop Norman Osborn, he used a black costume made of unstable molecules to disguise himself as the Venom. During the Grim Hunt story, after Kraven was recovered, he presented Peter with a black costume as a calling card after the Kravinoffs killed Peter\\'s \"brother\" Kaine. He once again wore this costume and became aggressive towards the villains, vowing to hunt them all down. He was about to kill Kraven with a spear until he was convinced otherwise by Arachne and <a href=\"/spider-girl/4005-40598/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40598\">Arana</a>. The black suit represents Spider-Man\\'s dark side.</p><h3><b>Iron Spider suit</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-230136\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5075\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-230136\"><img alt=\"Iron Spider\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Spider\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Spider</figcaption></figure><p>After the \" <a href=\"/spider-man-the-other/4045-43776/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43776\">Other</a>\" story arc, Tony Stark designed for Peter a specialized Red &amp; Gold costume that is similar to Tony Stark\\'s Iron Man costume. It was designated as Spider-Man Armored Fighting suit Version 1.1 which was made of a liquid nano-fiber. It provided Peter with the added functions of a short-ranged gliding function, increased strength, heat-resistant Kevlar microfiber that provided resistance to small caliber bullets, built-in fire, police and emergency scanners, visual amplifications such as infrared and ultraviolet, carbon filter in the mouth to prevent inhalation of airborne toxins, and a short-range GPS microwave communication system. All of which are controlled in the computerized control system in the titanium chest piece in the costume. Another very useful addition was a stealth mode which allowed Spider-Man to blend with the environment or even disappear completely in some backgrounds. Along with this came the customization option to instantly switch between any former style he\\'s worn (Spidey suit, black suit, normal clothes, etc); all on the same suit. It also contained three retractable spider legs called \"waldoes\" which can be used as offensive weapons. Spidey wore this costume before and during the Civil War but Tony, in order to keep an eye on Peter, had the costume feed him with information about Peter, notably the Spider-Sense. When Peter revealed that he was going to switch sides and fought Iron Man, the latter used a voice activated override which incapacitated Peter for a while. He had already known about this and used his computer expertise to disable the override and managed to defeat Iron Man with a surprise attack. He then discarded the costume and returned to wear his original costume when he joined Captain America\\'s team during the Civil War. The members of the initiative team known as the <a href=\"../../scarlet-spiders/65-44648/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Spiders</a> would start wearing costumes of similar design and functions.</p><h3><b>Spider Armor</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285272\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-ratio=\"1.3493449781659\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 229px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285272\"><img alt=\"Spiderman armor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif 229w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spiderman armor\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spiderman armor</figcaption></figure><p>While in an ESU laboratory, Peter invented a white &amp; blue suit that was made of steel plates that were from a pseudo-metallic composition using a modified webbing formula.

This version of the Spider-Man series debuted on ABC September 9, 1967 and lasted up until June 14, 1970. This story is about Peter Parker, a science student at a New York City</p><p>university</p><p>while witnessing a radiology experiment would be bitten on his hand by a radioactive spider. He then starts to find that he has amazing powers. He realizes that he has the spider\\'s leaping, wall-crawling, spider sense, increased endurance, and super strength. He made himself a red and blue outfit and mask and produces a web-spinning fluid enabling him to swing from the buildings above the streets of Manhattan. Peter\\'s first enemy would be the person who had killed his Uncle Ben. Uncle Ben would be killed by a burglar, a criminal that had ran past Peter earlier at the television studio. Peter didn\\'t really care at the time and didn\\'t help the police. This lead to Uncle Ben\\'s death. Angry and upset, Peter sought his Uncle\\'s murderer and webs him. After this tragedy, Peter would become a costumed crime fighter protecting New York. Peter Parker would be voiced by Bernard Cowan, Spider-Man would be voiced by Paul Soles, Len Carlson voiced Captain Stacy, Peg Dixon voiced Betty Brant, and Paul Kligman voiced J. Jonah Jameson. This series would also be well known for its theme song. It was performed by a vocal group with lyrics written by Paul Francis Webster and quick-tempo instrumentals performed by Bob Harris, published by Buddah Music, Inc. Lyrics \"Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size. Catches thieves- just like flies. Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man! Is he strong? Listen, bud. He\\'s got radioactive blood. Can he swing, from a thread? Take a look overhead. Hey, there! There goes the Spider-Man! In the chill of night, at the scene of a crime. Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time! Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Wealth and fame? He\\'s ignored. Action is his reward. To him, life is a great big bang-up. Wherever there\\'s a hang-up, you\\'ll find the Spider-Man!\"</p><h4><b>Spider-Man (1978)</b></h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2164020\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.96333333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2164020\"><img alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 600w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 600w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Japanese Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>The Toei Company had made a television series based on Marvel\\'s famous hero as a tokusatsu in <a href=\"../../japan/34-55746/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japan</a>.

It gives him a bracelet that not only grants him the same costume and the same powers as the American version but it also allows him to summon a giant robot (which looks an awful lot like a Power Ranger zord) to fight the evil of Professor Monster and his monstrous minions.

This was the second animated production of Spider-Man after its original series that started in 1967. This series was produced by the newly formed Marvel Productions, having risen from the ashes of DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. The company that had produced the 1978 New Fantastic Four and 1979 Spider-Woman animated series. This version\\'s character design would be later used for the series Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series and would have some of the same people play as the same characters. The character designs for the series were based on the classic style of Spider-Man artist <a href=\"../../john-romita/26-7499/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Romita</a> and were very similar to the visual look of the comics from the mid 60s to the early 80s. This series tells the life of Peter Parker a</p><p>college student</p><p>who lives a life as Peter and Spider-Man. They also used the same characters as before, such as: Peter\\'s Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson: Editor of the Daily Bugle, Betty Brant: Jameson\\'s secretary and classic damsel in distress, and later on during the series, <a href=\"../../robbie-robertson/29-1782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robbie Robertson</a>, Jameson\\'s assistant. Spidey also faces some of his usual foes such as: Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio and the Chameleon. This also included a six part story arc where Spidey goes up against Doctor Doom throughout the series. Spidey was voiced by Ted Schwartz in this series.</p><h4><b><a href=\"/spiderman-and-his-amazing-friends/4075-55/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-55\">Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends </a>(1981)</b></h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533828\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.83\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533828\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 400w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 400w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series debuted on NBC on September 12, 1981 and lasted through September 10, 1983.This would be the third animated adventure for Spidey which would end up being more popular than its previous series Spider-Man, which ended the same year this new show would start. After Spider-Man in 1981, NBC wanted to take Spider-Man on a different route which would appeal to more audiences. In this series, Marvel adds <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men\\'s</a> Iceman and adds a new superhero named <a href=\"../../firestar/29-2101/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firestar</a>.

The cartoon revolved around a 19 year old Peter Parker (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes) in his first year at Empire</p><p>State University</p><p>. The story begins with Peter already having his Spider powers and is a part-time photographer for the Daily Bugle. Spider-Man would battle many classic villains and newer villains such as Green Goblin (Norman and Harry Osborn), Hobgoblin, the Chameleon, the Lizard, the Scorpion, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, Rhino, the Kingpin of Crime, the Shocker, Vulture, Venom, and Carnage. Peter would eventually get into a romantic relationship with Felicia Hardy/Black Cat, and eventually fall for Mary Jane Watson. Although Gwen Stacy was never in the series, Marvel gave us a little teaser in the series finale story arc, having Spider-Man go to an alternate universe and meeting Gwen Stacy herself. A very important story arc in this series began as the finale of Season 3 in the episode entitled \"Turning Point.\" In which the Green Goblin kidnaps Mary Jane and throws her off the George Washington Bridge, similar to the story arc \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died.\" However, with the heavy censorship in the 1990s not allowing television to have heavy violence, death being a part of it. Marvel decided to have Mary Jane and the Green Goblin fall into an inter-dimension vortex instead. Season 4 was mostly about the guilt that Spider-Man has to carry for losing Mary Jane. He tries to rebound with the Black Cat, but Mary Jane eventually mysteriously returns to life. Season 5 starts off with the much anticipated Wedding of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson-Parker. With season 5 being the last season, Marvel dropped a bomb on us by revealing that Mary Jane was actually a clone created by Dr. Miles Warren.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-179794\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.68181818181818\" data-width=\"352\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 352px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-179794\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 352w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 352w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</figcaption></figure><p>To make matters worst, the Mary Jane clone was water based and was made for <a href=\"../../hydro-man/29-4457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydro-Man</a>. Next, Marvel did a tribute to the Secret Wars. <a href=\"../../madame-web/29-10670/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madame Webb</a> was going to help Spider-Man find the real Mary Jane, who was still alive somewhere. As Spider-Man continued his search for Mary Jane, Madame Web and the Beyonder set up a chain of events where Spider-Man faced different versions of himself from different universes. One was him, where he is a rich multi-millionaire, and wears a metallic Spider-Suit, and has publicly made his identity known to the world. This version was made to mirror Marvel\\'s popular super hero multi-billionaire, Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man. Spider-Man in another reality he went to, found out he was married to a woman he never met in his life, Gwen Stacey. Gwen had never appeared in the series until now. Gwen revealed information of another Parker alternate reality. This one was strongly grieving of the death of Aunt May, he cut his hair, died it blonde, and went out as Spider-Man. However, he met a foe he could not beat, the Carnage symbiote. The symbiote felt the pain of Ben Reilly as he changed his name to negate any Parker ties. The symbiote and Reilly bond to become Spider-Carnage. All of the different Spider-Man realities, including the real Spider-Man, battled Spider- Carnage. They could not defeat him however. When he sees Gwen Stacey, his love of killing is put on hold, since he has romantic feelings for Gwen he has never gotten over. He thus realized what he had become, and committed suicide. After all was said and done, one Spider-Man had to take him with him to his reality. This one is our world.

Spider-Man, in this series, was voiced by Rino Romano (making him the only voice actor to play both Spider-Man and Batman, the most-recognized characters from both DC and Marvel). This animated series was supposed to be the continuation of Spider-Man: The Animated Series show from 1994. This series would also take part in the future. The series starts off at the Polaris One site where JJJ\\'s son, <a href=\"/john-jameson/4005-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John Jameson</a> is talking to the public. About 6 months ago, through an advanced space warp drive engine, the man made probe called Alita projected itself to the far side of the sun where Alita recorded an exact duplicate of Earth. An Earth-like planet in the same orbit on the other side of the sun. John continues to talk about the probe being destroyed. Since then, people question should there be a man-made mission to go to \" <a href=\"/counter-earth/4020-54572/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54572\">Counter Earth</a>\". He goes on to say that there should be one to find out what was responsible for this and there should be an investigation. Peter then leaves to change into costume because his spider-sense is tingling. He sees Venom and Carnage and confronts them. The spaceship is readying for take off and Spidey battles Venom and Carnage while wondering what they are doing and why were they trying to stow away on the spaceship. Venom restrains Spidey and Carnage tells him that nothing will get in the way of them going to \"Counter Earth\" and joining the Synoptic. Spider-Man gets kicked off the flight and gets blamed for what happens to John during his mission. Six months later, they launch the Solaris II rescue mission to go to \"Counter Earth\". The Webslinger appears with his new suit featuring nano technology \"borrowed\" from the lab of Reed Richards. Microscopic robots cover his entire body with anti-symbiote devices. He is stopped by <a href=\"../../nick-fury/29-3202/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nick Fury</a> who gives Spidey a chance to redeem himself by taking the space shuttle to \"Counter Earth\", so he can go rescue John Jameson. Once on \"Counter Earth\", after almost being burned up on entry, Peter is under arrest and is sought out by <a href=\"../../lord-tyger/29-23429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lord Tyger</a> and the <a href=\"../../high-evolutionary/29-13346/\" rel=\"nofollow\">High Evolutionary</a>. Spidey meets the people who are chasing him, known as the Knights of Wondergore. Lord Tyger introduces himself and the rest of the Knights of Wondergore; <a href=\"../../lady-ursula/29-14834/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ursula</a>, <a href=\"../../lady-vermin/29-23430/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lady Vermin</a>, and <a href=\"../../sir-ram/29-14518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sir Ram</a>. While being chased throughout the city, he realizes that there is a high tech society where humanoid animals have taken over and the normal people live in the overpopulated slums. He was captured and told of what happened by the High Evolutionary who came from another planet to seek a place where petty humans squabbles; greed, selfishness, violence, and hatred was no more. He built his paradise with many experiments, using animals that he now calls Beastials. They are under the leadership of the <a href=\"../../high-evolutionary/29-13346/\" rel=\"nofollow\">High Evolutionary</a>, are stronger, faster, and free of the primitive human mind. Spider-Man was rescued by the resistance who had been told that the war lasted for 50 years. Spidey finds John in the resistance deciding to stay until the humans are free of the High Evolutionary\\'s oppression. Peter blends in with the humans to see what the \"Counter Earth\" world was like. After saving Shane Yamada-Jones from the robots, Naoko, Shane\\'s mother, a doctor, helps Peter. He takes him into their home, providing Peter pays rent, giving him two weeks rent free for saving Shane\\'s life. This series doesn\\'t last long. Only thirteen episodes were broadcast ending with a cliffhanger. Six more episodes were made for the second season but were never aired.</p><h4><b><a href=\"/spider-man-the-new-animated-series/4075-217/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-217\">Spider-Man: The New Animated Series</a> (2003)</b></h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392484\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392484\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The New Animated Series\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The New Animated Series\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man: The New Animated Series</figcaption></figure><p>This series debuted on MTV and aired from July 11, 2003 through September 12, 2003.

He ends up stopping <a href=\"../../sandman/29-3544/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flint Marko</a> and <a href=\"../../rhino/29-2126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex O\\' Hirn</a>.

The series artwork was created by <a href=\"../../sean-cheeks-galloway/26-5295/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sean \"Cheeks\" Galloway</a>. The same person responsible for some character design work for the <a href=\"../../hellboy/29-5466/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hellboy</a> animated movies. The character designs resemble those of The Batman TV series, as they have been designed by the same people who worked on that show. This series is supposed to be like the 1960\\'s version of Spider-Man. It doesn\\'t start off like all of the other incarnations of Spider-Man, starting off with Peter getting bitten by a radioactive spider but with a twist. Peter just starts his junior yeah of high school and gets pushed around by jocks. He made friends in Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy. Gwen Stacy is also Peters intellectual equal, getting a job working for Doctor Connors. Gwen and Peter also see their old friend Eddie Brock who Peters call bro because their parents were best friends. Both Eddie\\'s and Peter\\'s parents died in a plane crash. Ever since then, Eddie and Peter have had a close friendship. Peter betrays Doctor Connors trust by taking pictures of Spider-Man and Doctor Connors as the Lizard. This puts a strain on their friendship and their \"brotherhood\". Eddie knows about Gwen liking him but after all the things that he did wrong, it was the final straw when Peter goes to the prom with Mary Jane. This series is full of twists and turns. It ends its first season with Eddie being taken over by the symbiote and turning into Venom. After almost being beaten by Venom, he saves Gwen and continues to have a Thanksgiving dinner. Aunt May has come out of hospital after recovering from a heart attack, Peter cooks the thanksgiving dinner, Gwen brings over her family dinner and they all enjoy a nice meal. Peter washes the dishes and goes outside thanking Gwen for what she has done and for always being there.

Instead, the Sony owned Columbia Pictures have decided on a reboot of the franchise.</p><h4>The Amazing Spider-Man</h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4383735\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4814285714286\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4383735\"><img alt=\"Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-width=\"432\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 700w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 648w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 432w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 700w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 648w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 432w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-width=\"432\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Spider-Man and 10 years since the first Spider-Man movie, a re-boot of the Spider-Man movie franchise was launched.

The first game of the decade released was <b>The Amazing Spider-Man</b>, a puzzle action game released for Amiga, PC:DOS, Commodore 64, and Atari ST. Another game, also titled <b>The Amazing Spider-Man</b> was released in 1990 for the Game Boy.

Sega also released The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin the same year. The Nintendo home consoles were late to the Spider-Man party, but they saw many Spider-Man titles themselves. The first was <b>Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six</b>, released in 1992 and considered by some to be one of the worst Spider-Man games of all time. Not all Spider-Man titles followed original story lines. In 1994, Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage was released for the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. The game closely followed the <a href=\"../../maximum-carnage/39-41409/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximum Carnage</a> Story Arc. 1995 gave us <b>Spider-Man and Venom: Separation Anxiety</b>, which was released on the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo and the PC. That same year, <b>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</b> was released for the Genesis and the Super Nintendo; it followed the storyline of the series, with most of the characters being represented the way they were in the cartoon. The next Spider-Man game, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Fire</b>, was released for the Sega 32X. This game is one of rarest and most valuable Spider-Man games to date. For the next couple of years, no game completely dedicated to Spider-Man was released. He did however star in <b>Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems</b> and as a playable fighter in the 1997 arcade game <strong>Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</strong> (which later ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn) and then again once more in the arcade game <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes</strong> the following year in 1998 (which was later ported to the Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5094912-6860440742-spide.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5094912\" data-ratio=\"0.64715447154472\" data-width=\"615\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 615px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5094912-6860440742-spide.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5094912\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man 2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5094912-6860440742-spide.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5094912-6860440742-spide.jpg 615w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5094912-6860440742-spide.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man 2\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5094912-6860440742-spide.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5094912-6860440742-spide.jpg 615w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5094912-6860440742-spide.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man 2</figcaption></figure><p>Not until 2000 would Spider-Man return in his own game. Spider-Man made his triumphant video game return in 2000, with not one, but two games, as a character in a fighting game and a special guest appearance that year. <b>Spider-Man</b> for the Game Boy Color was published by Activision and met with moderate success. Later that year <b>\"Spider-Man\"</b>, developed by NeverSoft, for the PlayStation was released. The game was met with critical and commercial success. The game was ported over to the Nintendo 64 the following year, but lacked the full motion cut scenes due the systems hardware. Spider-Man was also one of the playable character in the arcade game <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes </strong>(which later was released on the Sega Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2, Xbox). In September of that year, Spider-Man made a special appearance in <b>Tony Hawk\\'s Pro Skater 2</b> as a hidden character. In 2001, sequels to the successful Activision titles were released. <b>\"Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro\"</b> for the PlayStation and <b>\"Spider-Man 2: Sinister Six\"</b> for the Gameboy Color. Spider-Man made an early appearance on Nintendo\\'s new handheld system, The Gameboy Advance with <b>Spider-Man: Mysterio\\'s Menace</b>. With the release of the Spider-Man films, the Spider-Man video games followed suit. <b>Spider-Man: The Game</b> was released in unison with the film in 2002. It was released on the PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, the Gameboy Advance, the Xbox and the PC. The game broke many sales records at the time. When <a href=\"../../spider-man-2/223-42/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man 2</a> was released in June 2004, <strong>Spider-Man 2: The Game</strong> was released the day before. The game saw release on the same consoles as Spider-Man: The Game did, in addition to the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. 2005 saw a comic related Spider-Man game hit the market; <b>\"Ultimate Spider-Man\"</b> followed many of the comic story arcs, and allowed the player to switch between Spider-Man and Venom. Spider-Man, voiced by Quinton Flynn, appears as one of the main characters in <strong>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</strong> and he has special conversations with Mysterio, Lizard and Scorpion, and Dark Spider-Man. His simulator disk has him saving <a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> from the Scorpion and <a href=\"../../aim/65-13497/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A.I.M</a> in the Omega Base. His costumes are his classic, symbiote, Scarlet Spider and Stark Armor costumes. Spider-Man\\'s latest film, <a href=\"../../spider-man-3/223-54/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man 3</a> also saw the same video game treatment as its prequels. <b>Spider-Man 3</b> was released on more consoles than any game before it. The game was available for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and 3, Nintendo Wii , Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS, the Sony PSP and PC. <strong>Spider-Man: Friend or Foe</strong> was released in October 2007 for Xbox 360, Wii, Playstation 2 , PC, PSP and Nintendo DS. This Spider-Man game features the villains from the Spider-Man films, but with a humorous twist.</p><p>In 2008, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</b> was released. It contained an original storyline not related to the movies, in which players switch between Spidey\\'s Black costume and his classic Red &amp; Blue attire. Player\\'s can dictate Spider-Man\\'s actions, as he can be Heroic or Villainous, as related to his dependence on the symbiote. Many characters appear including Venom, Kingpin, Wolverine, <a href=\"../../luke-cage/29-1450/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luke Cage</a>, Mary Jane and others. It also has 4 different endings based on the path the player chooses. The consoles for this game are PS2, PS3, PC, Wii, Xbox, Xbox 360, PSP. Note: The PSP &amp; PS2 versions of the game are very different from that of the PS3, Wii, Xbox 360 and PC versions. Spider-Man, voiced by Benjamin Diskin appears in <strong>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2</strong> and is also one of the main characters. In the Pro-Registration story, he can wear his Iron Spider costume.</p><p>Spidey\\'s next video game adventure was released on September 7th, 2010, in the form of <b>Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</b>. In this game, you can play as four distinct Spider-Men in four different universes, in search of the shattered pieces of a legendary tablet. The game sometimes features sequences where the player is in first person and has to use the analog stick to win the fight, much like in some boxing games. The first dimension is the Amazing Universe (Earth 616), the world of regular comics Spider-Man that we know and love, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris. He uses mainly far-range combat to defeat his enemies, it is known he faces Sandman in this dimension. The second is the Noir Universe, which takes place in the 1940s, in a darker, stealthier, and grittier setting, where stealth and timing is crucial. In this dimension, Spider-Man Faces Hammerhead, Green Goblin and the Vulture. The third is 2099, taking place mostly in the skies, with many free falling levels. In this dimension, Spider-Man faces the Hobgoblin with a new, more advanced look. The final dimension is the Ultimate Universe, where Spider-Man has somehow been reunited with the Venom symbiote as his \"gift\" from Madame Webb. He battles Deadpool and many other bosses with symbiote tendrils and many more attacks. Carnage is the main boss of this dimension. In the end you battle a immensely empowered god-level Mysterio.</p><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862583\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75111111111111\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862583\"><img alt=\"Spidey in action\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey in action\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey in action</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man once again featured as a playable fighter in the 2011 release of <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</strong> and its updated release of <strong>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</strong> and versions of the game would be released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Xbox 360. October 2011 also saw the release of the next Spider-Man video game adventure with <b>Spider-Man: Edge of Time</b>, developed by Activision and Beenox, the latter being given free reign after the success of Shattered Dimensions, which bears a similar gameplay concept. The game involves Peter Parker and his future counterpart Miguel O\\'Hara. New villain created for the game, Walker Sloan, has created a time machine in order to go back in time and start Alchemex, the company which Miguel works for, now was established in his own views in the seventies. Miguel proceeds to stop him but is caught in the portal after Sloan has entered and somehow becomes a \"viewer\" in the events. This gives him the ability to communicate with Peter Parker, who now works for Alechemex in this time altered universe, and everything he does directly affects the year 2099. Both briefly navigate their own timelines until circumstances force them to switch, now residing in timelines alien to them they traverse obstacles in order to get home through the temporal portal and solve the dystopian effects of the timeline corruption. The two work together to prevent Peter\\'s death at the hands of Anti-Venom, save Mary Jane from multiple danger, and even take on the CEO of Alchemex.

The results cured Miguel but also gave him spider-like powers. Aaron tried to shoot him but he fell from the Alchemax building despite Miguel trying to save him. Soon Tyler sent out a cyborg bounty hunter named <a href=\"/venture/4005-45134/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45134\">Venture</a> to capture him. Miguel fled to his home to escape Venture. Grabbing a costume from a Day of the Dead celebration he fought Venture and won. Miguel began fighting crime and the evil corporation Alchemax as Spider-Man.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Spider-Man 2099 was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/peter-david/4040-40682/\"> Peter David </a>and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rick-leonardi/4040-7043/\">Rick Leonardi </a>and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man-2099-1-spider-man-2099/4000-107620/\">Spider-Man 2099 issue 1</a> (1992).

Miguel had seen the spell performed and the bright light from it had temporarily blinded him to due his sight. After recovering he went to investigate. While doing so Spider-Man met the current <a href=\"/magik/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Sorceress Supreme</a> known as Strange. The two heroes stopped the undead forces and Morgez took his own life out of guilt for his failure.

Miguel arrives at the hospital upset that Dana and Tyler are together since Tyler is his father. Venom later attacks Tyler at the hospital while Miguel and Dana are there. Miguel leaves and goes to change into Spider-Man. Spider-Man and Venom begin to fight. The battle rages in and out the hospital and although <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> arrives they are useless, in the end Venom vanishes.

They later find and attack Venom and Mig changes to Spider-Man and finds that Venom has Dana too. He once again does battle, and as the SHIELD agents arrive, they fire at Venom only for the bullets to over-penetrate his body and kill Dana who was standing behind him. Miguel would grieve the loss of his fianc\\xe9e before plotting his revenge against Venom. Back at Alchemax, Miguel finds that Venom is weak to sound. He blasts noise from the city speakers weakening Venom and arrives and attacks him. He tries to kill him when the symbiote leaves its host. It turns out the host was Kron Stone, Tyler\\u2019s other son. Back at Alchemax he has both Kron and the suit imprisoned.

After the Goblin uses a hallucinating dust Spider-Man is able to close his eyes and get the drop on the Goblin, but he shows false images of Spider-Man making him look like a tool of the corporations and not a hero. People begin to shot at him meanwhile Valhalla begins to fall apart.</p><p>Miguel got the people out of the White House but couldn\\u2019t find Doom and later sees Thorites and the Vulture kill a Spiderite.

He later informs Tyler of his rise to power and although Tyler tells Miguel he\\u2019s his son Miguel says he knew. Miguel tried to see Xina but couldn\\u2019t find her and went to his office to find his mom as his secretary. The building was soon attacked by a group led by a man named Boru. Spider-Man fought him but Conchata ended it by giving him a meeting with Miguel.</p><h3>Atlantis</h3><p>Later Spider-Man had to save one of the researchers on <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">New Atlantis</a> from Sharks.

Tyler said he knew Miguel was Spider-Man and Miguel shot him but it was really only hologram.</p><h3>The End?</h3><p>Spider-Man got into a fight with the Goblin and during the battle discovered that it was in fact his brother Gabriel who was jealous of his brother and wanting power. The Goblin was able to escape from his battle with Spider-Man. Meanwhile the Atlanteans attacked the city as it flooded and Vulture was intent on bringing down the Alchemax building. During the battle Tyler was murdered by the Atlantean General Dagim and Conchata was thought to have perished. Spider-Man was able to escape and learned that Gabriel was in fact not the Goblin and the Goblin was actually a shapeshifter.</p><h3>The World Of Tomorrow</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506665\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/506665-spider_2099_arm_to_the_teeth.png\" data-ratio=\"0.91408934707904\" data-width=\"291\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 291px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/506665-spider_2099_arm_to_the_teeth.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506665\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man 2099-Ready for action!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" data-width=\"291\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/506665-spider_2099_arm_to_the_teeth.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/506665-spider_2099_arm_to_the_teeth.png 291w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man 2099-Ready for action!\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/506665-spider_2099_arm_to_the_teeth.png\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/506665-spider_2099_arm_to_the_teeth.png 291w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" data-width=\"291\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man 2099-Ready for action!</figcaption></figure><p>While in the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a>, the <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a> asked if Spider-Man would become the new President of the new society but he refused the offer.

When they refuse Miguel steps in and he and Scorpion have a brief fight that ends when the Scorpion reveals that all the Spider-slayers are active and converging on Miguel due to him being Spider-man.</p><p>Spider-man and Scorpion briefly clash until Miguel is forced to give hm the slip due to the army of Spider-slayers. The Scorpion enraged by his disappearance sets the Spider-slayers on surrounding civilians. Miguel uses Lyla to coat Scorpion in a hologram of Spider-man causing the Spider-slayers to turn on him. Meanwhile, Tiberius escapes when the building he is being held in collapses. His life is also saved by the woman who captured him at the expense of her own. Miguel and Tiberius head to the original buyer of the Spider-slayers where Tiberius reveals he no longer wishes to sell them due to the man potentially using them on his own people. Miguel and Tiberius then enter a vehicule where Stone introduces Miguel to Mac Gargan.</p><h2>Powers</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1850295\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1850295-429579_spider_man_2099_shooting_webs._super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.1324041811847\" data-width=\"287\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 287px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1850295-429579_spider_man_2099_shooting_webs._super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1850295\"><img alt=\"Web-swinging!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\" data-width=\"287\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1850295-429579_spider_man_2099_shooting_webs._super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1850295-429579_spider_man_2099_shooting_webs._super.jpg 287w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Web-swinging!\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1850295-429579_spider_man_2099_shooting_webs._super.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1850295-429579_spider_man_2099_shooting_webs._super.jpg 287w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\" data-width=\"287\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Web-swinging!</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man 2099 has powers similar to the modern day Spider-Man.

Instead he uses a web cape for gliding. His \"web cape\" was given to him by a \"Thorite\". One of Thor\\'s worshipers. This Thorite believed that Spider-Man is the Harbinger of Thor, and gave it to him, because, as the Thorite so rightly put it, \"The Spider-Man must be masked\".</p><p>His costume is composed of <a href=\"/unstable-molecules/4055-54225/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-54225\">Unstable Molecule</a> Fabric (UMF). This allows Miguel free use of his talons without the risk of damaging his suit, and protects him from slashing damage as seen when Superior Spider-Man takes a swipe at him with his claws but fails to cut the suit. It appears the UMF also protects against acid which Miguel notes in his battle against Venom 2099 who was secreting a skin-eating acid.</p><p>Miguel received a new high-tech outfit, courtesy of Peter Parker that improved upon his original suit. This time the Unstable Molecules were bonded to kevlar, greatly increasing its durability.

This resulted into the creation of an alternate 2099 reality, known as Earth 6375. Rather than being hunted by Alchemax, Miguel decided to join the Exiles in trying to fix time-lines that went wrong. He had remained with the team for various missions, his intellect helping to save the day on many ocassions. When all of the members were scattered throughout different realities, Miguel was thrown into the past of his own reality and decided to settle on that alternate earth (Earth-6375) with a new girlfriend, that reality\\'s Mary Jane Watson.</p><p>Not much was heard from Miguel untill a few months later, when he noticed, thanks to some Exiles equipment he took with him, that a group of beings known as the Inheritors had been killing Spider-like heroes through the multiverse. Miguel had taken it upon himself to warn other heroes of this looming thread. While he was spying on one of the Inheritors, Morlun, the foe noticed his presence. Miguel quickly aborted the spying and tried to travel to Earth 616 to warn his Earth 928 counterpart (whom was currently staying in that reality) about Morlum. But right at the moment that Miguel made contact with that reality, and was about to travel through it, he was caught and killed by Morlun. His girlfriend was left behind in grief and disgust. It was later revealed that the \\'main\\' Spider-Man 2099 of the 928 reality had received the Exiles armband from the Exiles\\' Spider-Man 2099. It was used by him in order to help the other Spider-Men in defeating the Inheritors.</p><h3>Spider-Man 2009:</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1850302\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.1133333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1850302\"><img alt=\"Spider-man 2099 &amp; Human Torch 2099\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" data-width=\"574\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82665/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 600w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82665/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82665/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 574w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man 2099 &amp; Human Torch 2099\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82665/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 600w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82665/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82665/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 574w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" data-width=\"574\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-man 2099 &amp; Human Torch 2099</figcaption></figure><p>A different version of Spider-Man 2099 appearaned in the Time-Storm mini-series.

If you can think of anyone who belongs on this page, please look them up and add them under the acceptable stereotype. If the character is not on the vine, please add him/her and do the same. Also, this page has a HIGH RATE OF SPOILERS, so please, if you are in the process of reading a manga story that you think will be listed on this page, read at your own risk.</p><p>A lot of people read manga or watch an anime and aren\\'t necessarily \"impressed\" by the storylines or character goals, and there is definitely a reason for that: The authors are using the same type of characters and storylines. The \"Save the World with your friends\" storyline can only be done so many times before people start to notice a connection, and it gets old. On this page, we\\'ll list the biggest and most noticed stereotypes to, hopefully, help any manga authors that run into Comic Vine and actually care about whether or not their manga story is impressive or original. This\\'ll also probably be a good read for some of our manga fans when they need a laugh, so forgive us if we seem \"unofficial\" with this page. Okay then, here we go:</p><p> </p><p>Among all of the manga and anime stereotypes, the most common that comes to mind is, no, not the main character who strives to be the best at something, not the \"mysterious\" antihero friend, no, not the main character\\'s amazingly awesome master, and no, not even the little heroine that keeps getting kidnapped by afore mentioned anti hero friend. It\\'s the one recurring story arc that continuously pops up, the one thing you can expect in basically any teen shonen manga, the \"Tournament\" arc. It seems that this arc is famous wherever it goes, as it\\'s an easy way for the writer to get all of the main characters who everyone enjoys reading to fight the other favorites, without any need for an actual reason, just their name being popped up on a screen, and, there we have it, a fight scene. This type of arc is predominant in basically any manga that focuses on fighting, and can be found everywhere, and, sadly enough, this extremely unoriginal arc is also almost always extremely long and \"important\" to the story. Ask any shonen manga fan and they\\'ll always tell you that it\\'s just the author running out of a way to introduce the next \"favorite\" character in the series.</p><p> </p><p>The most famous of these is more than likely the Yu Yu Hakusho \"Dark Tournament\" saga, one that lasted as an entire arc. That, or the Chunin Exams tournaments, which made many characters that had never come into contact before in Naruto fight each other, with no real reason, as it was a test to see who was a better ninja, not a better boxer.

These stereotypical manga characters always seem to wish to be the best at something for a benefit that is selfish, but that is shown to be perfectly expectable in the series. These character also always appear to be happy go lucky, and do very insane feats that are meant to be shown as humorous. This happy way of looking at life disappears whenever someone they care for is put into danger, to the point that they become dangerous, even to the point that they threaten someone\\u2019s life. However, when they battle the person who put their loved one in danger, they almost never follow through on their threat to kill them, usually resulting in the enemy to come back and attempt to kill them again. Also, this stereotype seems to always have some sort of hidden power which is due to someone in their family, and this power always seems to manifest when they are about to be killed, and more usually when their loved one is killed or appears to be killed (See Alter Ego).</p><p><strong>List of Innocent Main Character Stereotypes:</strong></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\">Naruto</a> from the series <a href=\"/naruto/4050-18836/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18836\">Naruto</a>: Naruto is perhaps the most well known of this stereotype.

They are hated by the teachers for their juvenile ways, and always have horrible grades. Then, the character is thrown into a situation that he still has to muscle his way through, and seems or be ill suited to take on by him/herself. However he unleashes an amazing power that he is granted right when he is in need of it, usually by a young woman (for example, <a href=\"/yusuke-urameshi/4005-45374/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45374\">Yusuke Urameshi</a> and <a href=\"/botan/4005-46257/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46257\">Botan</a> from <a href=\"/yu-yu-hakusho/4050-18948/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18948\">Yu Yu Hakusho</a> and <a href=\"/ichigo/4005-42468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42468\">Ichigo</a> and <a href=\"/rukia-kuchiki/4005-46355/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46355\">Rukia Kuchiki</a> from <a href=\"/bleach/4050-18244/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18244\">Bleach</a>) The main character, after being granted his/her strange and unusual powers, will eventually make friends, and soon becomes a force to be dealt with, despite him starting out as an average high school punk. This character will also usually gain an \\xfcber-powerful master that teaches them discipline, causing them to become even more powerful. Also, for some very strange reason, these characters are commonly given the task of hunting down supernatural beings after dying or doing something that should have resulted in their death, as well as being a sort of police officer. This, however, is not entirely a part of the stereotype, and appears to be more closely related to coincidences when writing the characters. They usually have no Main Bad guy, but more of Main Bad guys in different story arcs.

This could eventually lead to them becoming a Fallen Hero (see Below), but this is a rare occurrence. The Anti-Heroes usually have their past at the front of their mind, resulting in them to come across as a large amount of teenage Angst, and if this angst is shown two much, the character can commonly be labeled as Emo by fans of the series. These characters usually start out as a bad guy and though they become good, they still are a rival of the main character. Anti-Heroes are usually featured in stories focusing on an Innocent Main Character, providing a contrast between the two (though appearance in a series with a fighting protagonist is also commonly used, but just not as commonly.) The Anti-Hero is always originally at odds with the main character, but will eventually become friends with him.

This always leads to rejection in one form or another, from having the girl slap them across the cheek to learning that the girl was only a ploy to distract them. Despite their questionable activities, though, the perverted character is always very powerful, and helps the main character on multiple occasions, and will become one of the biggest friends to the main character, whether as a teacher or as a traveling companion. The main character grows to depend on their power, and also comes to friendly terms with their kind yet straightforward attitude. Also, the girl who the pervert mainly associates with will almost always gain an affection (and maybe love) for the pervert, despite the fact that he does multiple sexually harassing things to her on a daily basis.</p><p> </p><p><strong>List of the Pervert Stereotypes:</strong></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/jiraiya/4005-44511/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44511\">Jiraiya</a>:Don\\'t even joke about not knowing why this guy is a perv, please.</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/master-roshi/4005-53244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\">Master Roshi</a>: Of course, Master Roshi was the original master pervert, when it came to getting Bulma Briefs to flash him or simply staring at dirty magazines, he stayed perverted for the duration of the Dragonball/Z series.</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/miroku/4005-45470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45470\">Miroku</a>: The monk from Inuyasha, he always asked for Sango, wait, no, what are we thinking, any woman he met if they would have his children.

The character is almost always a character who had been introduced before, usually as being dead, and who hides their after their \\u201cdeath\\u201d or disappearance. Hint after hint are dropped for the character X stereotype\\u2019s real identity that it becomes less of a mystery of their identity and more of a mystery why the main character can\\u2019t realize it. Eventually, the identity of the main character is finally revealed, much to the main characters shock. The X-Characters are also known to come out of nowhere to save the hero at the last minute, say a few words of encouragement, and then leave the same way he appeared. This usually increases their fan-base greatly, but at the same time, it becomes slightly repetitive, and can lead to a very predictable plot.</p><p> </p><p><strong>List of Character X Stereotypes:</strong></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/racer-x/4005-43341/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43341\">Racer X</a> (one of the classics)</p><p><a href=\"/tobi/4005-45000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45000\">Tobi</a> (A case of being mislead into thinking he is another character.)</p><p><a href=\"/haku/4005-44244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44244\">Haku</a> (he was actually the boy in the mask, unbeknownst to Naruto)</p><p><a href=\"/riku/4005-45370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45370\">Riku</a> (when he wore the Organization XIII hood)</p><p><a href=\"/tuxedo-mask/4005-50670/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50670\">Tuxedo Mask</a></p><p><a href=\"/prince-zuko/47634/\" data-ref-id=\"47634\">The Blue Spirit</a></p><p><a href=\"/skull-man/4005-55071/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55071\">Skull Man</a></p><p>The Fallen Hero</p><p>===============</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Fallen Hero is one of the less known stereotypes in the Manga world, but it is still present, and therefore will be appearing on this page. The Fallen Hero is one who was originally a kind and caring fighter and person with morals seen as heroic, but, after a hardship in their life, they became a dark and evil force, and one of the main obstacles to the main characters. The Fallen Hero is always extraordinarily powerful, and commonly kills people close to the main character. Usually, their past is shown in a long, chapter long flashback that provides the question of why they became evil, and will later have an equally long chapter detailing how they became evil, and when they tell their story to the main character, they attempt to bring the main character onto their side, and though it seems to effect the main character, they never switch sides. The Fallen Hero will then attack him in a famous battle. The Fallen Hero has either two different possibilities, they will either die in after being forgiven by the main character, or they will become a friend at the end.</p><p> </p><p><strong>List of the fallen hero stereotypes:</strong></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/riku/4005-45370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45370\">Riku</a>:Sora\\'s best friend who fell to darkness attempting to save the remaining part of the Destiny Island\\'s trio, Kairi.

The influential deceased character always leaves a lasting impression on those around him or her, and never does the author EVER let you forget their influence. Usually, they always sacrifice their life for a great cause that is utterly selfless, and that sends the main character into the adventure they are experiencing. Also, regardless of what happens in the story, the influential deceased will always remain dead, though they may appear as ghosts or in dreams.

They are nearly always \"renegades\" and/or wanderers in the universes they live in. In most of these situations, the older brother\\'s younger sibling is either striving to become better than them, or to kill them, like Sasuke wanting to slay Itachi for killing his entire clan. These big brother figures are nearly never there to support said younger sibling in times of need, and are often the source of the younger sibling\\'s hatred. They are never good examples to said younger siblings as they make \"mistakes\" or commit horrible <a href=\"/itachi/44260/#The%20Clan%20Slaying\">crimes</a> that cause their siblings to hate them. However, in the end, these characters tend to come back and prove how they were such good people in actuality, by finding out that they actually attempted or did save them, to their surprise and disbelief.</p><p><strong>List of the Evil Older Sibling Stereotype:</strong></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/sesshomaru/4005-45469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45469\">Sesshomaru</a>: Come on guys, everyone knows our favorite white wolf demon.

They usually tell the main character what to do, and, despite the fact that the main character is usually a hard-head about certain things, they will eventually do what they are told. The bossy girl is also commonly used as a love interest for the main character, though this is not always the case, and in many cases it is left up to the reader to decide. The bossy character is always a gamble for authors though, as a reader will usually either like them or be seriously annoyed by them, and it is usually the latter. This is due to the fact that they are always obsessed with two things, the first one being interchangeable, and the second being beating up the main character. This kind of personality brings the character across as one sided, and it is very hard to actually add depth to the character. However, by the end of the story, you\\'ll enjoy seeing these hardy females go at it with their male partners, as they are often the only comedic part of the series left.</p><p> </p><p><strong>List of the Bossy Girlfriend Stereotype:</strong></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/asuka-soryu/4005-49802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49802\">Asuka Soryu</a></p><p><a href=\"/misty/4005-53326/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53326\">Misty</a></p><p><a href=\"/chi-chi/4005-40807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40807\">Chi Chi</a> from the dragonball/z/gt series. she was always bossy telling goku to stop fighting and gohan to do his homework</p><p><a href=\"/sakura/4005-44242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44242\">Sakura</a></p><p><a href=\"/ino/4005-44248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44248\">Ino</a></p><p><a href=\"/anna/4005-53483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53483\">Anna</a></p><p><a href=\"/keiko-yukimura/4005-46290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46290\">Keiko Yukimura</a></p><p>The Mascot</p><p> </p><p>==========</p><p> </p><p><strong>You saw it coming</strong></p><p>The Mascot is a character who is only there for the point of having a cute animal to show people knew to the series.

The magical girl is usually a young, beautiful girl who gives the main character of one of the main characters amazing magical powers. The Magical girl rarely ever does anything else except for tell the main character something about the power that should have been mentioned from the beginning.

This is a common stereotype for manga involving Mechas, and almost always appears in some way or form, usually as the main character. This can kind of draw away from the believability of the series, and can turn away many fans in an instant.

The Female Fan-Service Character is a must have for almost any manga series directed at a male audience. These characters are always shown with large and well exposed chests, a thin waste, and are always viewed sexually by the boys in the series. It is a very common occurrence for the Moe character to be groped and manhandled, only for them to 1. Cry in a very girly voice or 2. Beat the living daylights out of the person groping them. Also, Moe are commonly shown in costumes that elicit a fetish (ie. A nurse costume, a maid costume, sailor costumes with super short skirts, etc.) or are referred to as one of these fetishes. Some series also seem to be entirely created on the Moe characters. Strangely, though, the Moe characters commonly seem to have a positive reaction from male fan.

This other version of the character is always insanely powerful, but also amoral to the point that they can\\u2019t even be trusted to use their power justly (this includes having a spirit live within you as long as it can take control of the body to an extent.) The Alter ego appears when the character most needs it: when they are about to lose to a much more powerful opponent (A friend dying or appearing to die is also common.) The main character will then battle this old threat that had them beat second before, and will defeat them without the trouble they had experienced before. Although this appears very useful at first though, the character is then faced with the trouble of keeping this evil personality in check, though the character will eventually conquer this threat and be able to use the alter ego\\u2019s power without fear of losing themselves.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Examples of the Alter Ego Stereotype:</strong></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/naruto/44238/\" data-ref-id=\"44238\">Kyuubi Naruto</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/ichigo/42468/\" data-ref-id=\"42468\">Hollow Ichigo</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/jio/52954/\" data-ref-id=\"52954\">Satan Jio</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/seras-victoria/45136/\" data-ref-id=\"45136\">Vampire Seras Victoria</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/inuyasha/45371/\" data-ref-id=\"45371\">Demon Inuyasha</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/yusuke-urameshi/45374/\" data-ref-id=\"45374\">Demon Yusuke</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/kurama/45993/\" data-ref-id=\"45993\">Yoko Kurama</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/gaara/44258/\" data-ref-id=\"44258\">Shukaku Gaara</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/avatar/47646/\" data-ref-id=\"47646\">Avatar State Aang</a></p><p> </p><p>THE STEREOTYPE COUNT</p><p> </p><p>====================</p><p>Which series has the most manga stereotypes for action characters?

Congratulations Naruto. You are now officially the most Stereotypical on the vine\\u2026 Believe it.</p><p> </p><h2>Stereotypical Manga Concepts</h2><p> </p><p>Manga Deaths</p><p> </p><p>============</p><p> </p><p>Of course, in any action manga...well, any manga we can think of, somebody has to die, and here is a count of all the most used deaths in any anime/manga. Some of these deaths are pointless, like the pathetic deaths section below, as it only shows us tht the writer could come up with no reason to really make the character in the first place. However, these due make some dark comedic moments for readers, as many of these deaths are hilarious. Then, there are the tear jerking ones that really kill you to watch, as you generally know that said character is going to die, and said character happens to be one of your favorites. Also, it would seem that under no circumstances, under any reason, should a character be able to die a normal death, such as a heart attack or old age. If so, there must be a certain or special reason why this said character had to die this way.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Pathetic Deaths</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>Throughout every action manga, there is nearly always a death scene that was unnecessary for the series to progress, often just to show a new character\\'s \"power\" by instantly killing a/ many lackeys or side characters with no importance to the story.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Owned</strong></p><p>These characters are almost always antagonistic to the main character for some period of time, and only kill these people as an entrance for what seems to be a sheer lack of creativity for an introduction. The deaths of these lackeys are almost done in less than a second or off screen, proving the \"power\" that this new character/characters have compared to the main character. This action can happen in basically anywhere in the storyline, but it seems it is almost entirely necessary for it to cameo, in any manga that involves fighting.</p><p><strong>List of the Pathetic Deaths:</strong></p><p>note, this is a list of characters that have killed characters off insanely quickly, not the characters killed, as these nearly never play any role in the story or have a name</p><p><a href=\"/scar/4005-49319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49319\">Scar</a></p><p><a href=\"/wrath/4005-50262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50262\">Wrath</a></p><p><a href=\"/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\">Gaara</a></p><p><a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\">Zabuza</a></p><p><a href=\"/itachi/4005-44260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44260\">Itachi</a></p><p><a href=\"/aoshi-shinomori/45360/\" data-ref-id=\"45360\">Aoshi</a></p><p><a href=\"/saito/4005-51201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51201\">Saito</a></p><p><a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a></p><p><a href=\"/toguro-ototo/46049/\" data-ref-id=\"46049\">Toguro</a></p><p><a href=\"/hiei/4005-45368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45368\">Hiei</a></p><p><a href=\"/kurama/4005-45993/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45993\">Kurama</a></p><p><a href=\"/light-yagami/4005-48703/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48703\">Light Yagami</a></p><p><a href=\"/ryuk/4005-52039/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52039\">Ryuk</a></p><p><a href=\"/alucard/4005-44583/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44583\">Alucard</a></p><p><strong><em>Drawn Out Character Deaths</em></strong></p><p>Then, of course, there are the characters that have extremely long, drawn out deaths. These are usually very sad, foreshadowed, and painful, as can be determined by the way the character lived their life, like, say, Itachi from Naruto, or Zabuza, of the same series.</p><p><strong>Possibly the saddest character death yet in Naruto... </strong></p><p>These characters deaths generally bring out the good in them, or at least shed light on how they really took life, ie when Itachi, rather than attempting to rip out Sasuke\\'s eyes once again, poked him in the forehead, transferring all of his Sharingan techniques into him to keep him alive. Or Zabuza\\'s infamous charge through all of Gato\\'s minions. These deaths happen quite often, generally when you know the character is about to die, like, say, Shishio. However, his death was not necessarily one of a protagonist or revealing of the light within him, if there was any. Main villains of series always have extremely large, drawn out deaths, especially when represented in video games, where they seem to take up several minutes to simply fade off screen. Maes Hughes, of Fullmetal Alchemist, had a death scene that was extremely sad, killing him off in a phone booth, and Light Yagami from Death Note also had a death of this stereotype, making what was actually a minute\\'s countdown to a heart attack seem like an hour, screaming for help in the corridors of his mind.</p><p><strong>List of Drawn out Deaths for Characters</strong>:</p><p><a href=\"/itachi/4005-44260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44260\">Itachi</a></p><p><a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\">Zabuza</a></p><p><a href=\"/gato/4005-44966/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44966\">Gato</a></p><p><a href=\"/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\">Gaara</a></p><p><a href=\"/jiraiya/4005-44511/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44511\">Jiraiya</a></p><p><a href=\"/light-yagami/4005-48703/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48703\">Light Yagami</a></p><p><a href=\"/maes-hughes/4005-50742/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50742\">Maes Hughes</a></p><p><a href=\"/greed/50305/\" data-ref-id=\"50305\">The first Greed</a></p><p><a href=\"/kotori-mono/4005-43358/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43358\">Kotori Mono</a></p><p><a href=\"/the-third-hokage/4005-44513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44513\">The Third Hokage</a></p><p><a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a>(only to be resurrected)</p><p><a href=\"/shishio/4005-51136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51136\">Shishio</a>This refers to the final death of a character referred to as the main antagonist. This death is almost always seen, since the bad guy never wins. However, there are some cases where the Main bad guy reforms at the end of the series, and in this case, they will either live or have a drawn out character death. The Final victory death is usually the most climactic point of the series, with the hero, despite being beaten, battered, and 95% dead, is able to gain his true victory over the main bad guy and finally kill him. The main character will then somehow heal from his nearly fatal wounds and celebrate with his friends, and the main bad guy will always just be a bad guy.

Actually, when we say weapons, we basically mean swords. Name on anime or manga without a sword, we dare you. Every character has their own weapon, be it chakrams, a sword, an axe, their breath, who knows. But we do know that every character from the dog walking down the street to the old grandpa who sits in the cafe with his tea has a weapon, maybe not a fearful one, but a weapon none the less. Here\\'s a list of the most used:</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Swords</em></strong></p><p>Okay guys, there is no manga without one of these. There just isn\\'t, it has to defy some law. In nearly every manga there is a blade, and plenty of characters use them.</p><p><strong>The Masamune...a sword famous to gamers everywhere...</strong></p><p>These blades can list from anything short of a simple katana or a legendary sword with building splitting properties. the characters that use these weapons can have such diverse characteristics to their moral values and character that it\\'s impossible to call them a stereotype, but maybe a little diversity of weapons would be nice. One thing is for sure though, is that if a character has a sword, they can almost never be injured by a bullet or any other weapon but a sword...unless of course the character they are fighting is their master.</p><p><strong>List of Sword Using character Stereotypes</strong>:</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/kenshin/4005-45133/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45133\">Kenshin</a> Himura, the most famous manga main character with a blade.</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/sanosuke-sagara/4005-46676/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46676\">Sanosuke Sagara</a> Sagara, while he didnt use a sword for very long, he certainly used it well.</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/saito/4005-51201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51201\">Saito</a> Hajime, one of Kenshin\\'s bitter rivals to the end, though a good friend in the long run.</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/yahiko/4005-51200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51200\">Yahiko</a> became a second Kenshin, so of course he had a blade of his own.</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/kaoru/4005-51199/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51199\">Kaoru</a> was a practitioner of the Kamiya Kasshin ryu, and was also the teacher of her sword school.</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/aoshi-shinomori/45360/\" data-ref-id=\"45360\">Aoshi</a> Shinomori was the leader of the Oniwabanshu, and made good use of his blades in battle.</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/jine/4005-51197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51197\">Jin\\'e</a> was an amazing sword fighter and Kenshin\\'s rival, the only one to defeat Kenshin in battle throughout the entire series.

The gun will then be utterly useless, never being able to hit the main character, or when they actually succeed in hitting the character, they are utterly unable to hit then in a vital area. However, there is then the possibility that the main character has the gun, and in these instances, the main character is able to hit a fly five hundred feet away tied up with both of their eyes closed and with five hundred people in the way. A gun is only portrayed as \"useful\" in manga when held by one of the major characters. If used by some random enemy, the shots A.) Never connect, not once, not twice, out of one thousand shots; or B.) Directly hit the target multiple times and not do an ounce of damage to it.</p><p> </p><p>Manga Hair Color</p><p> </p><p>================</p><p> </p><p>The Hair color of a Manga Character has been shown to be a deciding factor in the personality and power of a manga character. This has appeared in almost every media where the characters can summon a great burst of Energy.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Silver/White</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>Whenever a character has either silver or white hair, there are oly two possibilities, they are either amazing powerhouses, or the are old. Let us begin with the insane power houses. Though these characters always appear to be just simple and never start out seemingly powerful, they are still capable of doing attacks assaults and all that of nearly godly perportions. For instance, if they originally appeared to be slow characters not being able to dodge something that appears to be amazingly easy to dodge, they later are able to move faster then the naked eye is able to see. However, if the characters are amazingly old, then they are either a main character or a side character that does nothing. If they are of the former, though, then they are still able to beat other characters early 100 years younger then them with ease, and be able to still do feats of inhuman perportions.</p><p> </p><p><strong>List of Characters with White/Silver Hair:</strong></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/kaworu-nagisa/4005-49821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49821\">Kaworu Nagisa</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/jiraiya/4005-44511/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44511\">Jiraiya</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/amidamaru/4005-51120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51120\">Amidamaru</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/kabuto/4005-44523/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44523\">Kabuto</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/kimimaro/4005-44262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44262\">Kimimaro</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/kurama/4005-45993/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45993\">Kurama</a> (when in Yoko Kurama Form)</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/sephiroth/4005-44472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44472\">Sephiroth</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/riku/4005-45370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45370\">Riku</a></p><p> </p><p><em><a href=\"/clare/4005-55531/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55531\">Clare</a><br />Red</em></p><p>Most of the characters with red hair are commonly hotheaded and commonly are some of the first to jump into a fight. Also, they always seem to have some sort of romantic attachment to someone, though whether this is about being obsessed with someone or just being a womanizers varies, however. Red headed characters are commonly in the fighting stereotypes (either fighting sidekick or fighting main characters). This hair color stereotype, though, is not nearly as common as the silver/white hair stereotype.</p><p><strong>List of characters with redish hair:</strong></p><p><a href=\"/kazuma-kuwabara/4005-46086/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46086\">Kuwabara</a></p><p>Manga Blood Types</p><p>=================</p><p> </p><p>The blood type of the characters in Manga is a deciding factor in their personality traits. The blood types of these characters is recorded in the the A/B/O scale.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Blood Type O</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>The characters who are born with the O blood type are characters who have traits where they are sociable and always get along well with others. They are also shown to be both agreeable with what others say, and are also the people who look at the glass as half full, as opposed to half empty. However, these characters are also commonly very vain, thinking only of what will best benefit them, and, do to there carefree nature, they can also be very care<em>less</em>. another strange negative trait for these kind of characters is that they can be very ruthless.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Blood Type A</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>The characters who have an A type blood are very earnest about others, showing their caring and nkind nature to all those around them (though they can sometimes be a bit to earnest). These characters are also creative, coming up with many different plans on the spur of the moment. They are also capable of being very calm and sensible in different times and areas, allowing them to be very analytical of there surroundings and of multiple different possiblities. However, they can be overly detailed in there plans, and can be very compulsive in doing their plans in the <em>EXACT</em> way that they planned.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Blood Type B</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>The Character with a blood type B are very wild about there lives, enjoying what the do, and they do do a lot. these characters are always doing what they set there mind to, and can not be stopped from doing what they want to do. These characters are also always seen with a smile on there face, enjoying what they do immensly. However, doing what they do, these characters can be very selfish, only trying to do what they want, as well as being irresponsible in there attempts at completeing there goal. Also, they are commonly very ignorant of the ways of the world around them.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Blood Type AB</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>A character with this specific blood type is commonly controlled and rational in his/her thought process. They are almost always unphased by the horrible things that they see, and almost always have the exact same expression, regardless of the situation which they are currently in. However, this rationla thought process can make them appear very cold, alienating them from their peers. These characters are also very indecisive, usually when their emotions are involved, as well as very critical of their peers.</p><p> </p><h2>Laws of Manga Physics</h2><p> </p><p>For anyone who has ever read or heard of manga has discovered the one total and godly rule for all manga, the laws of Physics are absolutely useless. Therefore, The Manga Laws physics, a list detailing the physical possibilities commonly found in Manga, was created. These Different physical possibilities are commonly found within Manga, and have been used so many times that they have now fallen to the point of a stereotype.</p><p> </p><p>please note that all the theorys listed in this section are meant to be satirical, and are by no means <em>actual</em> explanations for the concepts listed</p><p> </p><p>The Big Head</p><p> </p><p>============</p><p><strong>In times of anger, Manga characters are able to manipulate the size and shape of their head.</strong></p><p> </p><p>Characters in Manga are capable of increasing the size of their head. This ability only seems to manifest, though, when the character who displays this power experiences a large amount of anger at one person in particular. Their head then grows to a size larger then their body, and they will scream angrily at the person they are angry at.</p><p> </p><p>A variant of this law is that the characters face will change shape, their teeth will begin to show gaps, their pupils disappear, and their mouth widens incredibly, giving them a cartoonish look. Also, when they are not at the anger level that they shout at the person, a vain shall appear on their head, and shall bulge menacingly for a few seconds. This vein usually appears when a character beats their comrade down for doing something stupid.</p><p> </p><p>The Magical Yell</p><p> </p><p>================</p><p><strong>The voice of a character or their loved ones is able to increase the power of said character</strong></p><p>Characters in Manga, whenever they appear to transform, almost always let out a long and anguished yell. The cause of this is unknown, but it has been speculated that it is caused by excruciating pain caused from the power-up, or by the amazing pleasure caused by said power-up. Either way, this yell always seems to be optional, as later transformations will have this scream absent.</p><p> </p><p>In a similar fashion, whenever a character has been almost killed, the scream from a loved one is some how able to both heal the wounds to the point that they no longer plague the character and increase their power to the point that they can obliterate the enemy who they are facing.</p><p> </p><p>The Fourth Dimension</p><p> </p><p>====================</p><p><strong>Characters in Manga have discovered the ability to store different items in another dimension and to someone these items at will</strong></p><p>The Fourth Dimension has come to be one of the most used powers in Manga. This power is usually always held by the female of the group, and she becomes capable of summoning large weapons and such from this strange rift. However, this power never seems to be used in battle situations (many believe that this is because the immense aura of evil that the enemy puts off interferes with the dimensional manipulation of the character.)</p><p> </p><p>Common Items that are stored in the Fourth dimension are Mallets, Bazookas, and baseball bats. All of these also appear to be unable to cause serious injury to the person hit with them (theorized to be do to weakening of the atoms resulting from the dimensional shift.) As fellow fans of manga, we like to dub this unknown area (generally behind the female characters back) \"Malletspace\", as in multiple manga series it is shown that these characters have access to hammers behind their backs....hmmmm.</p><p> </p><p>The Hair Style</p><p> </p><p>==============</p><p><strong>The hair of a character is able to take on any color or shape, regardless of how impossible</strong></p><p>The Hairstyle held by characters is one of the most distinct features of Manga.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Need we say more?</strong></p><p>The hair is able to take on any shape that is wished by the owner of the hair. Also, even without the use of hair products, the hair of the character is capable of standing literally straight up, and can take up the color of any wished shade, from black to white. The style of the characters hair is even able to change shape and color with a thought, a most well seen in the famous Manga series Dragon Ball Z. Then of course, characters seem to be born with blue, green, or purple hair. Nothing special about it, and an albino seems pretty normal in any anime/manga world, just as often as you find a brunette.</p><p>Indestructible Hair</p><p> </p><p>===================</p><p><strong>All hair can not be destroyed by means of guns, energy, or fire. The only thing capable of destroying hair is a blade</strong></p><p> </p><p>Whenever a character is caught in a large explosion, shot in the head, or blasted by energy (which, in retrospect, would kill them anyways), their clothes are left in tatters, their body id bloody and battered, but their hair still keeps shape and style, and is never destroyed in these occurrences. So far, the only possible way to destroy the hair of a manga character is to have them narrowly dodge the attack. Their hair always seems to cut for dramatic emphasis, yet is strangely never shown any shorter after being cut.</p><p> </p><p>Also, it has been commonly noted that the power of a character seems to be dependent on their hair length, and when they become stronger, their hair length seems to grow. This is often sited as the reason for the invulnerability of hair, as it is a defense mechanism to control the character\\u2019s power.</p><p> </p><h3>Main Character Physics</h3><p><strong>The main character in an anime is always going to live through a fight, or be brought back after said fight</strong></p><p>Basically, any main character that happens to get into a skirmish and get cut, can not die from poison or blood loss. It simply seems to be physically impossible, as mentioned before in the deaths section, to be killed by something normal. Should debris from a crumbling building fall on a main character, they can not die from it, ever, unless of course they come back to life within minutes (in which case you can hardly call it dying). They also are able to defy the laws of physics at any moment during their fight, without ever being shown to do so before. Also, it would seem that a main character equipped with a blade is able to defeat any manner of opponent, and, if they happen to have a charging motion towards you, and there\\'s a sudden flashback/splitscreen/flash of light, and they end up behind you, you have immediately lost the fight, it would seem.</p><p> </p><h3>Fighting Sequences</h3><p><strong>During a fight, a character is able to display stamina that is not present at any other time</strong></p><p>Throughout any and all shonen action manga, there is always a fight scene. In fact, we can\\'t dare think of a series that would go without one, even in the direst of circumstances. There are tons and tons of fight scenes in manga and anime, but none are more memorable than the main character vs. his rival, or the battle that has been built upon for the entire series, ie The Sasuke/Itachi fight or the Goku/Vegeta fights. There are always the fight scenes that require little to no effort to see who\\'s going to win, but most of these are listed under \"Pathetic Deaths\". In manga, the fight scenes are always filled with epic moments, and generally last much, much longer than a fight between any normal human would have. We\\'d list the stereotype count here, but let\\'s face it guys, you can\\'t name a single character that doesn\\'t have an action sequence in shonen manga.</p><p> </p><h3>Introductory Scenes</h3><p><strong>Every time that someone is introduced into a series, they usually are able to instantaneously defeat an enemy, proving they do have some power.</strong></p><p>Now, every manga character has to have an introduction,right? Well, of course they do, otherwise they aren\\'t a character in the series. Well, this isn\\'t exactly a stereotype that can be avoided, but some of these intros are used way too much, like the instantaneous death entrance.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Yes he is O_O</strong></p><p>There are some good ways to introduce new characters that aren\\'t done ever so often, though, like Death Note\\'s L. All he did was say his name, but he made sure to be just as cool as any other manga anime character out there while doing it. Most main characters are introduced in a rather indifferent way, making them very boring to watch. Come on guys...Kenshin did it, not everyone else has to too...(when we say this, we are referring to the typical \"One Hit KO\" intro on the first antagonist of the series).</p><h3>Four</h3><p><strong>The number four, when mentioned, always has mystical proportions</strong>.</p><p><em>Okay, how does a demon become a Saint? I\\'m lost here</em></p><p>-Yusuke Urameshi, Yuyu Hakusho</p><p><strong>Suzaku, the Leader of the Four Saint Beasts</strong></p><p>Okay, so it is just a number, but it\\'s still represented in manga a lot...well, maybe far too much. There are almost always a group of four characters in a single group that the main characters have to fight, every single series that I personally can account for. these characters are usually mirror opposites of the characters in the main characters group, as there are usually four in this too, counting the heroine five, but of course the writers decide that she will never participate in a major battle. The most notable and memorable of these would have to be <a href=\"/the-four-saint-beasts/4060-46046/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46046\">The Four Saint Beasts</a> of Yuyu Hakusho. It was Yusuke\\'s (the main character) first battle where he could have actually died, and his friends (Kurama, Hiei, and Kuwabara) fought one of the members each, winning all of their battles. Of course, they were left behind and had to \"stop the enemies from getting in\" so yusuke could have his one on one match with their leader, <a href=\"/suzaku/4005-46045/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46045\">Suzaku</a>. Similar things happen in manga with characters like this, the leader can never be taken down like he should be, treated as a true threat to humanity, but only by the main character himself</p><h3>Singular Fight</h3><p><strong>Whenever a character begins a fight with someone else, they will be the only ones able to fight said person, despite any friends being there</strong></p><p>This law appears to be related to the \"four\" law stated before. Whenever a group of characters come to fight a super-strong main bad guy, they will always split up, one person fighting one of the enemies they encounter, leaving a clear path for the main character to run through to new enemies, even though it would be ten times quicker if all of them were to just gang up and defeat the enemy. However, when a five on one fight does occur, it is almost always against a villain who <em>can</em> fight five enemies on equal grounds (commonly referred to as Power-Rangers Syndrome).</p><h3>Death Powerups</h3><p>Whenever there is the death of a protagonist in a series, it always seems to strengthen the main protagonist. If it is the Main protagonist who dies, they then always become much more powerful and come back to life.</p><p>Related to the Magical yell stereotype. This law states that death is in fact one of the most useful things in the series, as it will always seem to strengthen someone (usually the main protagonist.) Though this would usually be attributed to an increased resolve to take revenge, the sheer magnitude of this power increase is much more then could normally be constituted by an increased resolve. One theory attributed to this is that when a character dies, they open up a dimensional rift to the afterlife, and the power resonating from the afterlife is then enfused with the character, increasing their power. This theory also seems to give a reason for the second half of this stereotype, an increase of power after death. Since the character is directl exposed to the power in the afterlife, they are able to absorb more, and therefore become total powerhouses</p><h3>Plot Devices</h3><p>Throughout manga there are many instances in which something should have happened, but didn\\'t, due to the characters role in the story, and often times no real explanation at all, and no reason to happen, say, the female hero running into the most dangerous character in the series, or one of the more dangerous ones, for no real reason, and being held captive by them, or \"escaping\", simply with the help of plot. This is extremely prevalent in many series. such as Orihime Inoue being captured by Ulquiorra Schiffer of Bleach, or Kairi being taken hostage by Sai\\'X of Kingdom Hearts. Among many plot devices, there is always a way to surpass the \"ultimate\". What we mean by this, is no matter what something is said to be the most powerful form or attack (ie, Super Saiyan), it will always be surpassed if addressed by the main character. Once something is said to be impossible, it is always surpassed and not even viewed as useful by the end of the series, among many of these being the Bankai of Bleach, the \"Hyper Gundam\" of G Gundam or any type of hyper transformations.</p>', u'name': u'Manga Stereotypes', u'deck': u'There are a lot of manga storylines and characters that all seem to have the same backgrounds and/or roles in their story.

It has been converted into an operational prison and is now known as \"Arkham Manor\".</p><h2>Pre-52</h2><p>Wayne Manor was located in Bristol Township, twelve miles away from <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a>. Further from Gotham there were caverns and tunnels that were sometimes referred to as the Catacombs. Bruce Wayne often played within these caverns before his parents demise. The Manor was designed by Nathan Van Derm for Darius Wayne in 1795.</p><p>The main use of the tunnels were to free slaves from the south and send them up the east coast and onto Canada. Each generation of the Wayne family lived in the manor and it\\'s remained one of the finest buildings in Gotham, until it was destroyed by a massive earthquake during the \"<a href=\"/batman-cataclysm/4045-42229/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42229\">Cataclysm</a>\" arc. It was subsequently rebuilt from scratch by Bruce Wayne choosing to be inspired by Cyrus Pinkney, Gotham\\'s original architect, thus giving Wayne Manor its Gothic design.</p><p>The new manor was designed not only with economics but security in mind to protect Bruce Wayne and the Dark Knight\\'s identity. The new structure still maintained the traditional grandfather clock that, by setting the hands to 10:48, the time of his parents\\' deaths, allowed Bruce Wayne access to the <a href=\"/batcave/4020-31340/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31340\">Batcave</a>. <a href=\"/alfred/4005-5556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5556\">Alfred</a> is responsible for maintaining Wayne Manor.</p><p>Recently Alfred, <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick</a> and <a href=\"/damian-wayne/4005-42413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42413\">Damian</a> have discovered new rooms with clues left by Bruce Wayne during his travels in time, which started after <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a> shot him with the <a href=\"/omega-effect/4015-48937/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-48937\">Omega Effect</a> during the <a href=\"/final-crisis/4045-51642/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-51642\">Final Crisis</a>. For example Dick found a secret room that is not on the original plans of the manor, this room has the word Barbatos written in big letters and the name Thomas written many times in smaller letters. The new batman also noted the paint was a year old tops and it should be from the 18th century had it been written by Thomas Wayne, the devil worshipper. This room contained another secret passage which let to the catacombs were Dick found a stalactite carved to look like a half human, half bat person. This sculpture is Barbatos, the devil-bat of the <a href=\"/miagani/4060-57604/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57604\">Miagani</a> tribe who was summoned by Thomas Wayne. Not long after Dick discovered the Barbatos sculpture the cape and cowl that Bruce used against Darkseid appeared as if it were and altar.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3><strong>TV Series</strong></h3><h4><strong>Batman</strong></h4><p>Wayne Manor appears in the 60\\'s <em><a href=\"/batman/4075-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-31\">Batman</a></em> series.

The mansion was subsequently destroyed and submerged under water after an attack on Hydrobase by Doctor Doom.</p><p>The Avengers returned to the original site of the Mansion, now dubbed \"Avengers Park\" and used the still existent sub-basements of the former mansion for their base of operations for a while. With help from architect Eric Masterson, Avengers Mansion was rebuilt and remodelled as a more modern complex. The complex was destroyed by Sersi during a conflict with the Gatherers. Ute the Watcher rewarded the Avengers for helping defeat the Gatherers by pulling from the multiverse an alternate reality version of the original Avengers Mansion in place of their destroyed headquarters.</p><p>The mansion served as their base for a long time until it was destroyed by Scarlet Witch. The Mansion was used in secret by the Young Avengers during a short period of time. Hank Pym\\'s Infinite Avengers Mansion was connected with the main entrance of the regular Avengers Mansion for easy travel. Tony renovated the mansion and gave the property to Luke Cage for $1.

Initially the series reprinted US <a href=\"/spider-man-adventures/4050-19157/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19157\">Spider-Man Adventures</a> stories, set in the Spider-Man: The Animated Series cartoon universe. When available reprints ran out, the series switched to using brand new stories written and drawn by British creative teams, and shortly afterwards, with issue 70, the series dropped the word Adventures from its title. In late 2011, following new instructions from Marvel\\'s US offices that original Marvel material was no longer to be produced outside the US, Spectacular Spider-Man switched to reprinting Spider-Man stories from the American <a href=\"/marvel-adventures-spider-man/4050-18094/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18094\">Marvel Adventures</a> imprint. This prompted a name change to Spider-Man Magazine, before changing again to <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/ultimate-spiderman-magazine/4050-79515/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-79515\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimate Spider-Man Magazine</a> when it started printing material from the <a href=\"/ultimate-spider-man/4050-48343/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-48343\">Ultimate Spider-Man</a> TV tie-in comic.</p>', u'name': u'Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures', u'deck': u'Panini', u'start_year': u'1995', u'image': {u'icon_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/2041813-01.jpg', u'medium_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/2041813-01.jpg', u'tiny_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/2041813-01.jpg', u'small_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/2041813-01.jpg', u'thumb_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2041813-01.jpg', u'screen_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/2041813-01.jpg', u'super_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/2041813-01.jpg'}, u'last_issue': {u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-413260/', u'issue_number': u'167', u'id': 413260, u'name': None}, u'first_issue': {u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-540454/', u'issue_number': u'220', u'id': 540454, u'name': None}, u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-43257/', u'count_of_issues': 60, u'date_added': u'2011-10-13 05:50:08', u'site_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/spectacular-spider-man-adventures/4050-43257/', u'id': 43257, u'resource_type': u'volume', u'aliases': u'Spectacular Spider-Man'}, {u'publisher': {u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-31/', u'id': 31, u'name': u'Marvel'}, u'date_last_updated': u'2015-07-27 07:00:26', u'description': u'<p>Trade paperback collecting <a href=\"/spider-man-the-x-men/4050-78717/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-78717\">Spider-Man &amp; the X-Men</a>.</p>', u'name': u'Spider-Man & the X-Men', u'deck': None, u'start_year': u'2015', u'image': {u'icon_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/4711807-01.jpg', u'medium_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/4711807-01.jpg', u'tiny_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/4711807-01.jpg', u'small_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/4711807-01.jpg', u'thumb_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/4711807-01.jpg', u'screen_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/4711807-01.jpg', u'super_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/4711807-01.jpg'}, u'last_issue': {u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-495807/', u'issue_number': u'1', u'id': 495807, u'name': u'TPB'}, u'first_issue': {u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-495807/', u'issue_number': u'1', u'id': 495807, u'name': u'TPB'}, u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-83467/', u'count_of_issues': 0, u'date_added': u'2015-07-20 14:01:56', u'site_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/spiderman-the-xmen/4050-83467/', u'id': 83467, u'resource_type': u'volume', u'aliases': u'Spider-Man and the X-Men'}, {u'publisher': {u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-31/', u'id': 31, u'name': u'Marvel'}, u'date_last_updated': u'2015-10-20 09:46:18', u'description': u'<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Spider-Man &amp; the X-Men Volume 1</strong></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">New ongoing series!

When warp storms caused the beacons to become useless, humans dispersed across the galaxy became stranded and civilization fell to its knees. For the following five millennia, mankind was plagued by Daemonic-incursions, xeno slavers, barbarian warlords and abandoned to their own fate up until the emergence of the Emperor of Mankind, an immortal born in 8,000 BC in Central Anatolia that possessed vast psychic abilities that silently observed from the shadows directing mankind up until he decided to take a more direct role, by forcibly uniting all warring nations on Earth under his banner.</p><p>He proceeded to create the Astronomican beacon, powered by his own psyker abilities that would allow FTL travel once again and led the Great Crusade to reunify mankind under his enlightened new order. But just when a new golden age seemed imminent, the newly-forged Imperium was wracked by civil war as half of the Emperor\\'s sons turned against him. The Horus Heresy was ultimately quashed, but at a terrible price: countless worlds were left in cinders, untold trillions were dead, and the Emperor himself was mortally wounded and forced to \"ascend\" to the Golden Throne, an arcane life-support machine.</p><p>The Imperium of Man is a highly militaristic, xenophobic, religiously-fundamentalistic, totalitarian dystopia that combines aspects from the Roman Empire, Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, Catholic Church and 1984\\'s Oceania. Its the largest, most powerful political entity in the known galaxy, consisting of at least 1,000,000 planets spread across the Milky Way and with at least trillions of inhabitants each, making their total number literally countless. Its form of government is a theocratic oligarchy with neo-feudal tribute system, allowing its member worlds to largely govern themselves as long as they recognize the authority of the Emperor and His servants and support the state religion, the Imperial Cult, which holds the Emperor to be the one, true God of Mankind. </p><p>Its a war-torn empire on the brink of collapse, under constant attack of xenos and Chaos, its greatest rival powers in the galaxy who are increasingly challenging the supremacy of the Imperium in the galaxy. In the present, science and human progress have essentially been halted in service to the need to simply maintain the crumbling status quo. From within its own creaking and increasingly stagnant and repressive edifice, the Imperium is threatened more insidiously by rebellion, mutation, dangerous psykers and subversive Chaos Cults. However, despite its myriad problems, without the admittedly authoritarian and often harsh protection of the Imperium, Mankind as a whole would have fallen prey to the countless perils that threaten it. Without the Imperium of Man and Mankind\\'s faith in the Emperor who guides it, the human race would have become extinct long ago.</p>', u'name': u'Imperium of Man', u'deck': u'is the galactic empire under which the majority of humanity is united.

The series takes place in the aftermath of the film, Spider-Man. Norman Osborn is dead in this series, thus making his best friend, Harry Osborn, having a vendetta against the web-head. Peter, Harry and MJ still attend Empire State University. All things were not going as he wanted when he has a sudden attraction to Indira Daimonji, an original character for the show. She serves as a foil to their relationship. Along the way, he fights KGB terrorists, a gadget using Robin Hood, a bird-themed thief, a brainiac kind of villain, sibling telepaths,a psychotic fan girl, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lizard/4005-1488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1488\">a monstrous reptile</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">a manipulative mob-boss</a> , <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">a shocking electrician</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">a murderous hunter</a> and assassins, including a magical sword wielding ninja, a fish-themed killer and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/silver-sable/4005-7608/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7608\">a female trained professional</a>.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Season 2 (No Episodes)</strong></h4><p>The final episode was forced to end in a cliffhanger due to low ratings. According to director, Brandon Vietti, Season 2 would have featured <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">a master of illusions</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/vulture/4005-4459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4459\">an old bird brain</a> and still the murderous hunter.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Reception</strong></h3><p>Though ratings were low, it has received positive reviews because of it\\'s dark tone and fresh take on the traditional web-head\\'s adventures, including it\\'s animation. On the contrary, some fans and critics question the use of original characters when there are numerous characters usable. It was nominated for two Annie Awards.</p><h3><strong>Trivia</strong></h3><p>This series was originally planned to be adaptations of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/brian-michael-bendis/4040-40435/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40435\">Brian Michael Bendis</a>\\'s fan-favorite run of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ultimate-spider-man/4050-7257/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-7257\">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>. However, due to the success of Sam Raimi\\'s Spider-Man movie, the series plans was changed, making the continuation to the film. Bendis\\'s run would be adapetd to Disney\\'s <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ultimate-spiderman/4075-13/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-13\">Ultimate Spider-Man</a> TV Series. The original artwork featured Ultimate counter-parts of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/rhino/4005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">a dumb muscleman</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">a scientific octopus</a> and <a href=\"/vulture-drago/4005-62054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62054\">a bird-brain wannabe</a> (this bird brain can possibly be the older version).</p><p> </p><p>In the episode, Mind Games: Part Two, Peter gave up his identity as Spider-man after his meeting with his enemies and the entire New York started to hate him. This event also happened the same time <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/spider-man-2/4025-42/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-42\">Spider-Man 2</a> was shown, where in he also started to retire as Spider-Man after believing he may not be meant to be Spider-man after all.

For Season 2 of the project, they created Marvel Anime: X-Men.</p><p> </p><h4>Reception</h4><p>Marvel Anime: Iron Man has received mainly positive reviews from fans and critics alike. The plot-line of the series was given praise for it\\'s more adult themed version of Iron Man. Both the English dub and the Japanese version were well received for the powerful voice acting and the action sequences are considered eye catching. The lack of characters were likened because it made room to more focus on the protagonist, and making it less confusing. In contrast to the praise received, many noted the repetitive use of only a few villains and was not entirely fateful to their comic-book counterparts, like most of the future seasons. Nevertheless, this was said to be one of the best of the program.  </p><p> </p>', u'last_episode': {u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-11342/', u'episode_number': u'105', u'id': 11342, u'name': u'Outbreak'}, u'name': u'Iron Man', u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/series/4075-335/', u'image': {u'icon_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/3768187-4167895574-11583.jpg', u'medium_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/3768187-4167895574-11583.jpg', u'tiny_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/3768187-4167895574-11583.jpg', u'small_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/3768187-4167895574-11583.jpg', u'thumb_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/3768187-4167895574-11583.jpg', u'screen_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/3768187-4167895574-11583.jpg', u'super_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/3768187-4167895574-11583.jpg'}, u'date_added': u'2014-04-18 02:00:08', u'site_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/iron-man/4075-335/', u'id': 335, u'resource_type': u'series', u'aliases': u'\\u30a2\\u30a4\\u30a2\\u30f3\\u30de\\u30f3\\r\\nAian Man'}, {u'publisher': {u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/publisher/4010-2746/', u'id': 2746, u'name': u'Capcom'}, u'date_last_updated': u'2014-02-19 07:12:33', u'count_of_episodes': 27, u'deck': None, u'start_year': u'1994', u'first_episode': {u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-8563/', u'episode_number': u'101', u'id': 8563, u'name': u'The Beginning'}, u'description': None, u'last_episode': {u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/episode/4070-8578/', u'episode_number': u'214', u'id': 8578, u'name': u'Crime of the Century'}, u'name': u'Mega Man', u'api_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/series/4075-281/', u'image': {u'icon_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_avatar/3653026-megamantitlecard.jpg', u'medium_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_medium/3653026-megamantitlecard.jpg', u'tiny_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/square_mini/3653026-megamantitlecard.jpg', u'small_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_small/3653026-megamantitlecard.jpg', u'thumb_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_avatar/3653026-megamantitlecard.jpg', u'screen_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/screen_medium/3653026-megamantitlecard.jpg', u'super_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/image/scale_large/3653026-megamantitlecard.jpg'}, u'date_added': u'2014-02-19 07:12:04', u'site_detail_url': u'http://comicvine.gamespot.com/mega-man/4075-281/', u'id': 281, u'resource_type': u'series', u'aliases': None}], u'version': u'1.0', u'limit': 10, u'offset': 0, u'number_of_total_results': 27265}\n"
